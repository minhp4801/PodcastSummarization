You are listening to Irish illustrate Insider. It is Friday, March 6 we witness nor Dame's first spring practice on Thursday, March 5th. And thank God. I don't know about you guys. But those those last couple of podcasts leading up to pre-spring and pre-august if I skip one. Yeah, give me something give me something to work with and we certainly have something to work with feel like we're answering August questions in February. I know I know but yeah, I mean everybody's interested in that stuff andThat's what we do but it's good to have a practice under our belt we can talk about that will talk extensively about that. I want to start with the in book because and Pete I saw you put out a list yesterday of the guys that stood out to you and I put out a list this morning of the five that the five that thrived I thought yesterday and I we were pretty comparable there especially at safety check out your list, but but Ian but I mean I thought he and book. I mean he really really threw the football very well. Timing was good. Remember when we turn to each other that that seam route to Tommy tremble, it was perfectly placed and then he had a over the throw catch on a like a short Corner route by lenzi that was perfectly placed as well. I thought Ian book definitely hit the ground running yesterday. Yeah, I was just sharpen. It didn't it didn't feel like a big Revelation either. No watching it. It looks free and easy and it'll what he should be doing. I mean how many times are we at a practice and we're like sort of oversee. King every single things of quarterback does watching every throw we all watched every throw in book made but when they were completed or they were really on point that one over to zukor Mo it's a lengthy that was there you reference like everything else is just like yeah, this is what a figure and I mean is what a fifth-year senior quarterback should do. It was like a feather, you know, it arrived like a feather fall from the sky. I think I use that term this morning in the story. I mean, he threw a lot of passes like that and it's going to be beneficial for future practice. Sports because now we don't have to really pay attention to the comparison of e-book and anybody else we can watch Brandon Clark and Drew Pine Brian fight it out and improve over the spring. We it's you look great. He's going to and he should have look great. We don't overdo it. I mean the corners they had their number one corner out their safety Pete found out later hurt his ankle during practice Kyle Kyle ham. I wonder I wonder why he was curious who the number one safety. Well, I just thought Go ahead at their afternoon trunk podcast. Yeah, I get it. But I'm just but you should look good. It's control and I wonder why he was laying off a lot of stuff and as it turns out I guess he is human turned his ankle. Yeah. It's like what he's not picking up. He hasn't picked off three passes in this practice. What's wrong with him today with strange have people on Twitter be like, what's with Kyle Hamilton? Was he like this? Like be second your safety regression themed now he did. He's he'll be fine. You know, I mean, I really thought that Obviously Kevin Austin showed, I thought Ben skowronek showed. I like his size. I mean, I think he's a you know, it's kind of a stereotype to say possession type receiver, but I think his size. Yeah, we'll help him be a inviting Target for Ian book. Yeah. I thought it was strange to me that of the to grad transfers been skowronek was the one that turned my head the most that I think we all sort of came in thinking like what Isaiah Pryor is going to be kind of a plug and play play. And that wasn't even really show anything to back that up. He did help onesie Griffith also had her probably the best practice we've ever seen him have he did Griffith took only way to couch that. We said it during practice was he was lining up one-on-one with the tight ends and I will say though. He's the only guy that made a play on Tommy tremble who had a really good practice. He ate it really nice for you on tremble. But when you're lying and Brock right is Rock, right did every rep but we also found out Brock right might be nursing a little bit of an injury and you just try to make it through that practice. So while all the guys got torched by Kevin Austin Houston Griffith didn't have a chance to be. Yeah, he shouldn't be having to go one-on-one against Kevin Austin either. That's why he's moved to safety. But I thought Griffith had the best practice by far he's ever had because I have never noted Houston Griffith for doing anything to practice before. He looked really good. I thought DJ Brown you mentioned demon DJ Brown to I thought he did some did some good things now. He's playing where the number one safety is playing behind him. But if he you know, I mean if he proves To be the second best safety. I'm sure you move me that spot but it really refreshing to see Houston Griffith have a good practice. If you want to make a point. I don't remember who is against prior made one really nice play fast break up in 11 on 11 to was a McKinley. But either way it wasn't I have already made a nice play. I thought the best part about Kevin Austin was we weren't shocked when we just waiting to say like, yeah, that's what Kevin awesome he was still better than I thought it was going to be exceeded my already high expectations. I mean he was making some just like Making treat bracelet High School, right and there were a couple catches where it's like, oh that's going to get knocked down. How in the world did he make that catch Johnny stays up and stays up like miles Boykin and Chase Claypool fall down. They're still great catches, but then Kevin Austin seems to have like sort of an acrobatic ability to then keep his balance and then just score a touchdown after it. I think there's a critique of him. I'm going to save that. We have a question in the second segment. We'll talk about that a little bit. More but the lens he played. Well McKinley played. Well, it was a it was a pass break up by prior on McKinley that you're referring to right near the end of practice really bullied the corners. That's what he looked. Yeah. He really did. He really did a lot of Caleb offered Matt you did as well good, but I mean he got somebody got some treat Bracy to I wrote at least three tri-rac matchups with because I accidentally watching yeah bracing bracing kind of late in the day. She struggled on a couple plays but you know, I still like I still like their odds with Mike. Ins coaching him Jeremiah woo-suk or ammonia just like when he's on the field, he draws your eyes to him whether he's making a player not just because of the way I mean, he's an impressive athlete out there and then so he was one of my five just because he kept his there but he just kept I mean, he just kept showing up around the ball and seem very active and I you know, you want to mix in some some defensive players as well, but it's a hard practice for defensive guy. Like if that's why Houston Griffith is notable that is just a difficult practice to shine in because you're not allowed to hit at all. You're not allowed to bring anyone to the ground and Maris Leaf out did hit it exactly was like it's better with you and Ashley came heart came in almost took out Brandon Clark out a nice throw but it's a very difficult spot to be in with the whole field one-on-ones. It's almost like we don't need to read we need to really be careful how we report on 100. Once this you should beat them. Well for on a three out of five times while other that's why and then what maybe all yelling would make what I reported on were the defense only the defensive plays that were made there were like seven out of 35. No, I mean they're actually there were seven defensive plays in one-on-one and 35 snack and that is probably too much one way, but it's never going to be 50 50 50. It's know it you don't ever see that. It can't be that's like shooting open jump shots, you know, I mean those should go down and that's that's pretty similar so offensive line. Josh log at right tackle while it's just I mean, it's all a function right now of who's healthy because when they came out in Tempo gosh log was the left guard in place of Arron Banks who can't practice creamer in haensi can practice so they were out there but once they started doing any work where you could get your foot stepped on or your knee roll up accidentally to someone falling in top of you log went to right tackle with Dirksen Grant Right Guard and then left guard was conquering her calendar and heartless are Yeah, so but that's all of this is a function of the injuries at this point. So well as versatile as a whole spring is going to be that way with the offense of line. I mean, I know Brian Kelly they're not going to let they're not going to let haensi and Kramer get involved in any contact their limited because he said they were limited even though he said they were not limited but if you're on a GPS limit, that's a limit. Yeah, and that's fine. Like it's unfortunate for the lines cohesion and like making a step forward which they have to make regardless of whatever this narrative is that They were totally fine last year. That's a group that can get a lot better but it's hard to get a lot better. If all five guys aren't out there working in that they're not going to have a single spring practice for all five. They might not have a full when the spring game comes around. There won't be any banks and I guess I would be surprised if Kramer and haensi did anything that won't play in myself. No way. No way on the defensive side of the ball. Of course Shane Simon out Howard cross Irish Illustrated have reported that well in advance. Lazy was not a place. It was not on ya know Lacey's I mean even in the spring the guys the guys tough, you know, I give the kid a lot of credit Jack lamb out. I may have I may have misinterpreted or Miss wrote something else there. But Brian Kelly said, he's three weeks out from taking the next step you're not he's not three weeks away from participating in the spring. So so that has created a situation at linebacker Jeremiah woo-suk or ammonia Rover. I'm You know what? I'm fully onboard with that now. Yeah, he was also on your list of top performers exactly was so good, right? Thank you for fully onboard. Never know who's going to be the buck Jordans in Markeith. I still just don't see that. He'll get plenty of opportunities as spring. I don't mean honestly if I actually came out with a number two's at one point, I don't see it at all. However, I didn't really see it. Mike linebacker Drew white of the first practice starting last year either and that's now and again at any played. Well we can you know, it's we got to give it a little time to Clark lie with George a murky. Can I just say this about I mean when you look at Norton's linebacking Corps, I mean physically you look at Notre Dame's linebacking Corps it when you look at Drew white and you look at JD Bertrand your white hits you look at the old man, he no, I'm not Say nice temperatures going up. I'm not saying they're not there. You know Drew I'd had a good year. I'm not saying they're not good players or a JD. Bertrand's going not going to be a good player. I'm saying when you look out there to practice and it's the linebacking group. You'd like to see a more impressive looking group of linebackers, but I have I agree with you thought that presently physically that's fine. But over in the corner rehabbing, unfortunately top-five player on the company line backer and a top 10 player on the team's linebacker coming back though. So, I think it's just Just a it's okay. So Simon and I am physically are ya more impressive I guess but lamb was you know, he's still not a still not fully broke gain the weight to these going to need to play at I don't know. I just I you know when you hear what you're saying, I mean you don't see Jaylon Smith. You don't see Tavon Coney through tranquil. That's what they look they look bigger when I think you know in jail specialist here. So it was Joe Schmidt Schmidt was at Hill pressing you physically you're not No, I agree. I mean, I agree with that. I'm just saying that Notre Dame should have a more physically impressive looking group of linebackers. That's all I'm saying. All right, yes, but on that topic of where guys are lining up right now the I believe the three linebackers last year or Shane Simon Rover Drew white middle linebacker and Bilal buck. And then Bilal moved her over artist the start of spring and then we'll all moved her over Simon moved to Buck Wild Mike White got hurt. I mean below Paul played all three he did. Yeah, it's a son before he made the first move. I don't know if he took a single snap at Rover during spring but he was still a writer from the previous and then Simon played all three because I remember you asked him is getting easier and he said no, I don't know. Yeah, I don't know it. You know, I thought breaks you look good look better early than he did late. I thought it was interesting the cam heart who definitely is limited physically was still running with the number two's ahead of KJ Wallace. I don't know that Isaiah Rutherford showed anything that I can comment on he showed that it got wrapped. Yeah, I was gonna say he got a lot of fat. Well, yeah because yeah that was a who do you put out there the coaches decided we're going to go with run right? It was about period 15 that they kind of shut down Crawford. He had a bit of a hamstring. I turned it to him at one point and said, I didn't know it looks like that far. Yeah, I think so. Maybe maybe he's a little bit earlier. But he was involved in the drills and all that. Yeah, he's right. Yeah. So yeah, so rather forgot a bunch of reps and that's good you need some but I'm not sure that I saw anything per se a player anything that that stood I thought oh via gufo coming off the edge one time. It might have been against Maybury. He was really he was really good. Look it wasn't it was look it was it was an explosive burst off the edge. I think he's one of the more Intriguing players of the spring I agree with you. I want to be interrupted you once him on Lua file. He's the one of the more intriguing players right now. There's no doubt. I give him two positions to look at right? He's another guy that your eyes are drawn to him a because his hair is flying all over the place, but it's but it's more it's more than that. He's just a bouncy. He's a bouncy athletic mobile guy. He lost 8 pounds. I did the weight thing. Is that right? Yeah, so I think but what they have my 221 he went down from 229 lat. Anyone, I just took the rest last roster we ever had to the next roster is all you can do, you know Zeke real gain in 20. Yeah. That was a terrible thing. Yeah, you know, so he's to 21. So if he can get up to a good to 30 by August, which is very reasonable. Is that big enough? Is he big enough to play that position? He lost it for possible Rover work too and he's not going to win that job. Of course, you know as they said we'd ever don't think I could it was a co-worker move over if a little house with yeah, that's why it hurt. Yeah. I mean you can have more than one line backer and he's obviously We going to be running down under every kick and punt away from ya could be a matchup thing to like maybe there's some games where you know Bears works that are bucking there's some games were you know, it's like you have a Georgia style opponent like then it wouldn't be a gram true now and I great he'll be on everything special teams. He's just that good of an athlete. He really catches your eye who else on defense Aaron's Burger. I didn't install man. He's tall. He was actually in individual reps in positional reps. He was actually rubbing it nose tackle, but I think that was just a balance out. stuff You know, asafa Mensa is a little late to which really hints that he would be. Baby, wait, wait, wait, he's 13. They moved just Anatomy all of the to the big n which is of course the right move behind opened a g. So. You know, it's pretty well pretty well balanced across that defensive line. Despite a couple injuries. Yeah, big defensively. I do, you know something I was thinking about last night. This is probably the third straight year where you look at the defensive line and say like that's the best position for both the team which is pretty amazing and people have been around Notre Dame a long time that the defensive line would be that consistently talented and that consistently deep or it's happening every year now season that's happening every year now and they were pretty good the first year there would L cocaine because they were they were just didn't have the impressive athletes, but that was Kareem as a sophomore emerged remember, right? Against USC acquire started playing 400 stamps, they'll and Hayes was not great and already thought he would because he was a sophomore at everybody annoyance people, but they were pretty good. I thought about that and I was like, I wonder know they weren't the best. No, they weren't the best truth but they were good thing that started be there right now. Let's think about if they could get the offense of line to the level that it needs to be and should be if you can say the same thing, you know shouldn't I thought they should write it. That's what I'm saying. I don't know why you're not saying that every American should be a conversation. Yeah, let's talk I did. If one group is better than like we should be able to have a debate an honest discussion every year like which group is better the offensive line of the defensive line the defensive line to win that. By a lot for three straight years. Yeah, you know that you could have more balance there. I think that would be healthy. Let's move on with that point because Brian Kelly did kind of take offense to a question about the offensive line needing to improve we said we all need to improve I need to improve that. It's he answered in truth, but everybody can't be Batman. The quarterback has to be better the wide. Yeah, they all have to be better. However, I don't think I think he's just sick of hearing it. He's defending Quinn. He's defending Quincy has good players there. He doesn't always reason no real good reason for him to light a fire in the media under them. It doesn't do any good to say why they need to improve probably just all behind closed doors. He just not going to go with that narrative. Now. I am going to ask him at a pertinent Point how they can improve on third down because they were so bad on on Third and short time. See ya on Third and short they were so much worse than they normally are and it it does hurt your team you Again, skin good getting big games. You have to be able to convert those things. I know you can win some games that are crazy head knockers like they could have won that first, Georgia game being terrible on third down, but it's because they were so amazing on third down defense. You're not going to go beat Clemson and go 1 for 3 on Third and one. Okay guys who perform on Third and two right is you have to be able to convert those things? It's just that's the problem now, they pass protected really well mostly year. They were really good at that Brian Kelly mentioned that he wanted. Added in questions about Tommy Reese. He want his offensive coordinator to be the quarterback coach. So he certainly wasn't going to get rid of him and Joe Moore had never had a chance to become. Offensive coordinator. Yeah chances of Nationwide massive total search that but compost every coach in America that could have come in and coach Notre Dame Tim. Remember you would have had to somehow move reefs out of there. Right which he wasn't legit wasn't going to do and so that's part of the reason why Tommy Reese's the offensive coordinator now, Interesting comments about what free agency can that's that's coming in college sports, which was the term that Mike Brey gave it Brian Kelly Sue. I was allowed to go from Central Michigan to Cincinnati and Cincinnati to Notre Dame. So why shouldn't a player's be allowed that he started trending now? Yeah and of comment, but then he said well I had to be successful to move up. I don't know how that correlates to a player. For ingrate transfer the most players 99% transfer because they're not successful if transfer down. He's thinking of the famous quarterbacks that are now transferring and getting well, right right right by far the most transfer away from a situation. They can't win. Yeah easily in the history of all of basketball and football. They're not Demetrius Jackson This freshman year was going to be like man. It's not really working out here right now. I'm gonna go duke. Curry had gone to Georgia Tech. He stayed and thrived I use him because he you know, he had he's the guy that opposing coaches said he is the model player trying to stay. No it'll left from a purely Self Service perspective. These are the transfers no room would like to take into the program. That's the guy who's really good at Iowa State or the guy who's really good at Cal U be like, hey, you're good there what you want to move up you were successful there. We could take you you could help us, but I don't that's not a reason that the waivers. Be allowed for move up, but not move down. That makes no sense. But yeah last thing here and I want to ask you about this because you asked him about leadership from from book and I he didn't really answer your question when you asked it but a little bit later he did he talked about basically that IAM books leadership. His presence is enough. He just needs to be in book and I totally agree with that. I don't think at this stage in book doesn't have to he doesn't need to be anything different. He doesn't have to try to be louder. I think that'll I think that is all coming naturally to him now that he's comfortable and knows he's the man but I just I don't I don't think that he needs to change anything. Just keep playing it Kelly Kelly reference it, you know just complete a whole bunch of pastors and that'll be good enough and I and I bait you to use a different term is an apple. Yeah. He's a little different term than that, but I agree. I mean, I agree just beat just just keep focusing in on what you do and be you and that will be plenty of leadership for this offense. I think credibility was a term that I use in the question. I think that's that's what he has so much more now, they did last year from the highs and the lows of last season that guys are automatically going to look for him look to him for direction. He's not going to have to convince them to listen to him or convince them to follow him. I think there's Good, like you're saying is there's sort of a natural flow to that free ebook. Now, you know somebody like Liam eichenberg I think is a little bit different. We heard him talk way more yesterday in practice than I then I feel like I've heard in the past maybe some of that is because haensi and Kramer and Banks aren't out there, but that's a guy who can be like, all right, I can cut this loose a little bit more this this team freshly this offensive line right now needs it, but for book overall at that was it This was something that I wrote about yesterday like for everything we saw in practice session today to me. It was like what we did in here was as significant than the sort of observations for the season because it was a team that went out got its work done and they got out of there. There wasn't a lot of yelling jumping around kind of fake hype no one was trying to bring energy, but it didn't but it wasn't a lethargic practice either if this is sort of a more professional locked in Then that's good. I think that's sort of where he in book is I agree with everything you're saying but I think you know, I don't want to read too much into the first spring Palace. Yeah, and you're right. I mean, normally the first spring practice is everybody's yelling and jumping around and screaming they didn't need to do that. They went out look when your quarterback throws accurately that makes for a very efficient practice as well and no balls look like they got shot out of here, right? Exactly.

So you never miss an episode segment two burning up the boards. We start with a question from eat pickles. What were the top three plays of Thursday? What were the not top three plays of Thursday? Why I guess I'll go with Houston Griffiths breakup of Brock writes the past. So I think Ian book through it to Brock right that would be on my top three of the in book pass that we were was already over a woo-suk or ammonia to lens. Z and then you could have a pic of about a half-dozen catches by Kevin Austin. Yes. Those would be my top three and you're not exaggerating that bottle right now is about a half-dozen and you've made a good point about him staying up and it was concentration juggling. I mean they were athletic but they were just case Claypool leaping High into the air and grabbing the ball. They were he is being contested little he's catching it no matter what when there's a little struggle it was his it was tipped. It was his if it was low it was his You get other than one case of but it was high. It was his it was just really a good effort. He looked a lot more like the receivers you see running around on LSU. Then what Claypool or Boykin were a poor physically a big? Yeah, they move like they are straight line speed their physical they box you out. They catch the back shoulder all that stuff. But if you watch the national championship game and some of the catches that Jamar Chase was making that's a little bit more what Kevin has bringing to the table. I thought there was I don't even even know at what point it was the practice but Kendall abdelrahman has a nice cat that ball was by him and low and he made the grab which We have a question about him then we'll give it back to him as he's learning the receiver position, but I thought at the end of practice I thought I thought Javon McKinley made a couple of really really nice plays one on fro from Clark one of them throw from book. You know know the aforementioned as you said the the the seam route to Tommy tremble was just dropped in there absolutely perfectly and tremble had another one where he kind of ran through Hamilton's Jam downfield your jam because it's a one-on-one drill. So you're getting a little more handy than you're allowed to write. I thought he powered through it. It looks like that's a that's a man running through it. That's a good place. I tremble tremble. It's a really nice place Chiron Williams might be the In a one-on-one drill come out of the backfield caught a pass and you're not allowed to tackle, but you're allowed to touch and George Mr. Keith was not able to touch Karen Williams in space. I don't know. Yeah, that was a that could also be on the good place. That's go. Yeah, very very good shake and you should probably tap him. Yeah some point so I would put that on there and I think Griffith got was it right Pete that are you talking about the one where Griffin it was early in the one-on-one rhetta route. Yeah, like okay. Yeah. It was great. I thought it was tremble. He read the route and even though Sold. Well, yeah, he broke out underneath. Yeah, that was a nice play. So those were yeah. Those are the best ones not play Whenever Colin Wilson sprained his ankle was clearly the worst player. Yes. It's like man. This guy's a dog out here. Come on makeup like it. There was another DJ Brown was defending tremble and book could even make the throw. It was a little underneath. It was a little underneath Road just cross the line of scrimmage by defense. Yeah. Yeah. That's probably it right with reader practice reports. We have your All-American big back somebody crying tires illustrate or early impressions of the new hires. I watch mickens much more erroneously. I watched the technology. I watched McNulty more. It seemed if people want to write keep everything was actually thought I was doing the defense the defense so but I thought the most impressive part with mickens was when Ramon Henderson got beat by Xavier Watts who probably push off a little that's why Henderson stopped wants kept going and scored. You're not supposed to stop everybody yelled to him macon's a win over and immediately explained everything like it wasn't like screaming at him. What are you doing? Did you he's like was he was he oughta polish was he audible to I couldn't hear him. I just watch him come over. He didn't have a look-see nor was McNulty, although there were a lot of Consultations going on with Nick Nolte in the title and Soldier coached a team. That's a good point. You can always hear Brian polio. There's no doubt about that is voice could be gone and it was the first practice of spring you need spring break. He's 12 days. So we don't really I mean, we don't really have an opinion about these two assistant coaches. They were out there has a very hard job this spring I think is going to take use the patients to get it done. It's it I think they both of them have really unique job. They're different the mickens. It's a rebuild of a position to coach it back up because there's just not a ton of material. There has been recruited very well. It's amazing to me that in the junior senior fifth-year senior and sixth-year senior class. They have two corners. That's that's not a great roster management. You made it sound worse to that's really it it beside me. That's a good reason for McNulty. I feel like it's similar to what my calcio had to do in 2017 where there's a confidence rebuilt of that group of the tight ends. I think the tight ends were much worse for wear working or not working with chip long. Sprained Kelly intimated and I sort of heard some Rumblings of that that the Titans there was some like really getting to click coaching to play if I could clarify for everybody Brian Kelly talked about how when you're offensive coordinators the tight ends coach. Sometimes the players that get shorts change shortchanged are the tight ends and I get that. Yeah, except I had heard about that last year. I kind of dismissed it but then to have Brian Kelly say it which means that he's taking feedback from the roster itself. Which is probably the most significant thing in the whole part that he's listening to the players and the coaches and what feedback he's getting. I think McNulty is sort of a confidence rebuilt. They have the Titans feel good about who they are. I can write Jim underscored boonie underscore CRS physically. How would you compare Kevin Austin the previous wide receivers and I guess that's a Claypool Boykin probably probable reference. I thought I mean physically if you just look at them romantic night comes to mind. Me but he's much more athletic than McKnight has. This is not mine. But I'm going to steal it from Greg from uh, Andy who's one of our Twitter followers a lot of interaction. He's physically reminiscent of bears Daniels. Stronger probably but this sighs sighs sighs this dude. Look at him. He's so thin. I'm sure he's this long thin and yeah me I pick Daniel one. Yeah, I pictured Daniels is a little bit longer just in general longer. I don't know what the actual height comparison we should go that was used receive actually pizza. That's it. Yeah for Chase, you know, but we referenced a ball that was a jump ball and he just physically you know, I mean, I wouldn't mind if he was built a little bit more along the lines of claypole in Boykin because I think that he is lacking a little bit of strength in this one particular 50/50 ball and we were talking about He allowed Bracy to out physical him and that I thought he missed jumped. I know we're on the opposite side of maybe he was kind of off balance when he did it. Yeah, but anyway, I just don't want to I'm the one that's been saying Kevin office is going to be the lead receiver is going to hit the ground running and he did he did that yesterday, but I thought on the flip side, I don't want to say that he's a complete player because I think there's still a lot to his game. Mainly the physical part of it that needs to be developed. It's her Zombie by the grace of God what storylines are comments coming out of the first practice are we overreacting to and what if anything are we under reacting to? Hmm? Are you sure that's it's an interesting question. I think you're over reacting to anything you're reacting to because as I said last year guys just gonna start moving around. This is not theirs to they're not in pads. They are not allowed to go to the ground at all. Even when they jump in the air. They're not supposed to go the ground. It's The third practice when they were pads is a little bit more indicative of what you're going to see two football team. Did we over I mean, what did we what would he have overreacted to? Yes, sir. The way Kevin Austin played? I don't think so. I mean he may plays. Yeah, I mean, I guess if your takeaway was 75 catches 1,500 yards and yeah, well, I think also if you think because Bracy was getting beat by Austin and McKinley that he's not playing Corner. Well, I mean he's that would be an overview an over reaction. Okay, I agree with that. Houston Griffith I crouched up by saying he didn't make it so wide receiver. He could be Houston covid Isaiah Pryor Dynamic. We got a long amount of ground to cover on that one is for day one. Yes, I'd give Houston Griffith the check mark. Do you agree though? The most important thing was we have never seen him to make a big place in practice. Yeah, and it's I mean to be fair last spring there were a couple spring practices where we would come on this podcast and be like, that's the best practice I've ever seen Brock right have and then in the fall. Didn't really translate to into a whole lot. So that spring is O'Malley probably makes the best point. It's like directing anything. You're probably overreacting to it. There's a spring practice that we've got to react to it that he means but if you said well, I don't know no idea what I'm eating what we see as a it's indicative of something that's going to happen in the season. Yeah, there is not a lot to that. I'm going to skip we're going to go back to these two questions because Denver Maximus overactive is something I must have written if I must maybe I wrote a poorly Denver. Xmas what were your impressions of Brendan Clark with him now knowing he's One play away from this being the starter. It sounds like Drew Pine is not ready for your report. Whatever. I wrote must be wrong because that's an overreaction. True. Pine is just not as big as the other quarterbacks. That's what I wrote. Well stature. He is physically smaller. He's not ready to play after one practice in college, but it's not from he's not ready for my report. Yeah, if I wrote that improperly yes physical his stature. I remember obviously earlier old. I remember watching Tommy Reese's spring practice as an early enrollee. They were really bad. Really bad, but that's kind of what happens where you're a high school kid in college like you have to go there. So these are the worst practices of Drew Pines career. Yes, right. Now, they're gonna be worse we can get because it's like it's okay to have a growth mindset about this whole thing like it's healthy. This is where you got to start somewhere and then you get better Caleb offered definitely other words practice life. Can you imagine going out there? Just having running into Austin and McKinley the whole time they're grown men is brand-new. New out here. Yeah, he got he got torched quite a bit. I will say this in the Denver Maximus question regarding Brennan Clark. We don't know him. I did you ever hurt you never did you ever do any with him? I did something with them, but I couldn't say that I came to look at you. Like well this guy's all right, but here's what x y or Z. Here's what I think we know about Brendan Clark he's tough and he he's physically tough way with and I think he's tough-minded and we would base that upon opinions from the former offensive coordinator and I Set upon the opinion of Brendan Clark's personal quarterback coach who are always biased right Malcolm Bell. I get all that but I mean it's blue-collar background is death firefighter, you know, it's like there have been plenty of quarterbacks who come through here. I think a little bit more I guess white collar or I don't know how to describe it. But like Brendan colors kind of just more of an athlete who plays quarterback opposed to somebody who's gone through the quarterback churn out machine, and I think that Really exist nowadays. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, absolutely. I mentally I'm confident. This is one thing that I think I'm confident of that if he gets thrust into that situation mentally he's as prepared as somebody without any experience can be I think he's tough-minded. I think he's tough. That's That's a good starting point, but he gets the moment will be the reason just good defense. I'm sure I'm sure yeah, I mean, I'm sure the moment will be big it would be big for anybody but I think he will be as prepared as somebody could be already this since I skipped out of Washington DC with Xavier wants looking more advanced physically than most early in early skill players. Do you think I'll be hard to keep me off the field in some capacity if he catches on the offense quickly? You know so many other receivers step forward yesterday that you weren't really I wasn't really thinking in those terms but I do I do sure do like the way it looks on a football field. I guess. It depends on how deep they decide to go. They usually talk about going deep and they don't feel they have guns. Not even they have to go deeper than the God wants two years because they relied on Veterans, but you have Austin you have lenzi skowronek and McKinley McKinley's going to play. I mean, yeah, he's gotta start making plays a big games on against New Mexico, but Billy's Gonna Fly that's Four guys there he's is going to find some time. So now you're going from that point that's five guys that will find playing time. You have two tight ends are gonna play a lot in right and tremble. So it's all about opportunity. I think it's I mean dancers. It's easy to keep them off the field because there are other guys would have my like as if he's really going to play out. Why behind Lindsay and then behind skowronek? I don't think he's going to get ahead of either those guys in Jordan Johnson is coming in also had a lot of reps to go around. No, maybe not but you know abdulrahman again, we have questionnaire away to that. Michael Jones isn't going to make an impact J burnell's coming off an injury Joe Wilkins was sick yesterday with strep throat, but I was like what? Mechanical five receiver. Yeah, that's that's why I named the lost its chronic McKinley. Lenzi Keys. That's five definite. Can he get ahead of Joe Wilkins? Sure, that could get you playing time. Keep them alive with sold is like if they're thinking ziggurats the scoring three touchdowns this year that's would be real because he can if he can get in a the top six there they want to play more receivers. He can get some point done some playing time. Yeah, I'm not I'm you know, just based upon yesterday. I'm not sure that he did a thing. This is Olga. He's got a play head of these other guys hit his impression on me was more he is more advanced physically relative to his position. The other early enrollees, I agree with that jet which is not a you're definitely going to play. It's just an observation about how you are compared to six other guys will all one's injured the five other ones play with their position. So you mentioned it to me during practice. You're pretty much pleasantly surprised. He didn't look skinny. I thought it was going to look at a pretty wiring kind of an underweight nut wasn't a Peaceable Peter fits. Well, ask what has your what has you most concerned about this team going into the spring in the question is how big is OV a gufo other offensive line and the ability to like get that run game going which that's a an August solution. I mean, it's an August story. Really? Yeah because based on injury here in the lack of Chris Tyree and you know, maybe Trevor Speights if he shows up as well. It could just be a completely different. Good potential solutions to this in the fall and I did not watch over you goof a whole lot but it sounds like he was very impressive. I mean, I just I athletically you like him. I think he's got a he's either been it's probably a combination list. He's been taught very well by my kelston and he's learned those lessons and I think he's a pretty Adept pass rusher having said that You know, we're I think we're all kind of assuming that they're going to have a pass rush again and they just lost three guys to put a lot of pressure on the quarterback is a great point and to follow up with that. The best thing that could happen to Oviedo Foo is the day on Hayes comes back healthy and plays 600 snaps in a go food place 350 because I'll go Foo has not he can come off the edge against Josh Lockheed come off the edge against good players. I think there's a play on the boundary or In book looked at it Go food, and I'll go through has to make the decision and it's a read option and he held the ball perfectly and I go food made the wrong decision for half step and Ian book ran around with the boundary for what was an easy 10 yard gain. I was going away from going away from that and that is just something that Dale and Hayes would have paused and made the play on and that's more important over the course of 13 games that have been come off the edge one time because if the only as can start and then play a different role in the dime, like he did a couple years ago and they that great Diamond a tofu comes in for him to rush off the edge I'll acquire Large Amir Jones. I think that's his best. If he can have a role similar to Jamir Jones last year, that would be a while. I would think so. Oh, yeah, that would be a tremendous. That would be tremendous. I think he's going to make a solid contribution how much we remains to be seen we can fan. What is holding Kendall Abdul Rahman for making the jump or is it simply too early to tell I think what I mean, he he doesn't know he didn't know how to play wide receiver. He never played wide receiver coming in last year. I think there were some adjustments to Notre Dame that that he had to go through as well, but he made that great catch that we referenced yesterday and he seemed to be getting coached up a whole bunch yesterday, which we had not seen much other than for maybe a practice or two in August of last year. I don't remember him getting corrected for any you get corrected for a wrong route or something, but I don't see him getting corrected for doing something wrong that makes sense like rowing Henderson this what happened to abderrahmane last year. He quit at the end of it. Of a drill he did not a practice multiple times and that is yeah, which is fine, which is totally of ever practiced. Why would you know how to practice it is to learn by going through it? Right? It is definitely too early to tell okay are what we could give up or not. But you make a great point to he had to adjust to being a college of Notre Dame because he didn't not play a single down last year when you're allowed to play four games because he was ready to go in and do something right so he's coming from that far away. But yeah East he's made I can remember for good catches now from Last August and this includes any silly flip he flashed yesterday and we'll take it from there PD halls in 10 games. Colca met had 43 or substance for 515 yards and six touchdowns. I'm a big Tommy tremble fan and have him going over in all three categories over 13 games. What do you guys think about that? I've never again and I swear to this ever going to predict again because I predicted it for Tyler eifert. 3rd & colca Matt and I can't believe they didn't do it that someone will beat the record of six tight ends at Notre Dame six touchdowns for a tight end of Notre Dame's held by Kim McAfee and now Cole commit no one's ever going to do it. That's what I'm saying. It'll never happen in the history of the sport no matter how much they outlaw running the slogan of tied down to get seven touchdowns because of cold command didn't get his seventh touchdown last year with three games to go. I don't know what to tell you. All. Right, so say nay on the hundred rounds, but what about the 43 receptions in 515 yards? I think right now the gate if the season started The second target behind Kevin Austin the second most targeted player so he would go over that but I don't know if it'll stay that way when wide receivers develop and things like that. I think there could be like Kevin Austin with 95 targets and everybody else like five guys with 30 fewer targets than him or not. Five three guys with 30 40 fewer targets. You know where he's yeah. I think I don't know the number to guys why I think they're really, you know, I think you can you gotta try to force feed Lindsay a little bit just that he's not an easy target guy. No, no, I get it. I get it. But you know, he'll be he'll be another seven pounds bigger by August and they they've got to get the football in the hands of players like that Chris Tyree him. I mean key Keys has to be a little bit more explosive. But so you're saying good year, but under under under Wyoming I agree with you the under on the touchdowns like a he go over on yards. He's Pete gets plays downfield. Yeah, just like you have to 80-yard plays get you over this going his average pet cats is going to be greater than kmetz, because commit you're throwing to underneath a little bit more JJ alwine. What are your thoughts on Carrie Cooke's as an analyst was he in the running for the cornerbacks job? I had no idea. I believe using the right I do not believe he was either as an analyst. That's it's a welcome development for Notre Dame that Notre Dame would have an analyst that you know who he is. Because I've been fairly anonymous because they haven't been the co-defensive coordinator Notre Dame or the quarterbacks coach should Oklahoma. Yeah. It's an opinion. Certainly trust ya that I don't I don't see a downside to Carrie Cooke's joining. Her name is Anna doesn't know that all know. I don't think it's like a game changer. No, but he could recruit on campus. That's that's really good too. I mean Jeff Quinn was an analyst and yeah, it was able to recruit on campus and he's a good recruiter to it had to help I bet that helps with Quinn was here. We'd maybe some insight that you know, hey, here's something that didn't work for us at AMA that you guys are trying they would have it's like yeah is kind of where you know that can get blown up. But you know what Terry Joseph sort of leading the way there and then Mike make ends and then Carrie Cooke's the welcome addition. It was also enjoyable two, but three of us be looking down there and same time exact Carrie Cooke's that's why it's a better seat. Now. There's so much better doesn't make the playoffs. What will the reason be there are four better teams. I was gonna say and you lost it comes in. There's three better teams in one's coming in and then that can knock you out of them. I mean you could just name. Well, I'm sorry Alabama and they are probably going to be in the playoffs and Mel. I'm sorry. I didn't read a whole question because it's or the statement specifically what position groups Clemson's quarterback is that this probably know I kept asking. Well I counsel yes is defensive line. Yeah, that's doesn't just these are just tough which basically in the top for Notre Dame's Corners pretty sick right now right now you should Kidding. It has to say that yeah, that's we've we have where bent for since this podcast started earnings offensive line has to be great. Not really good. Great for it to be a playoff Contender maybe a lack of a real true. Number one running back you may they may not they may not have that either. I that's a good point because what were you saying yesterday? I like Notre Dame's all these number two guys running around out there, right? There's just not a number one. Yeah. Yeah. We're going to we are going to finish with a couple of basketball questions because we had a we had a major why in spite of well because of because we had an unusual no those are the questions just answer White House I'll take water and your nerd am absolutely positively should have defeated Florida State at home the other night and they didn't and they they choked they didn't have a very good strategy down the stretch Mike Brey kind of had postgame meltdown situation and so I'm not asking any of the questions I guess I'm just kind of I mean Clark delabar one asks what is the outlook on Mike Brey continuing the coach of Notre Dame a I was for the first time this year I went from thinking out of course he's going to try and come back for one more year and right the ship to I am I am as sure as I can be that Mike Brey will resign at the end of the year. I think he's done coaching at Notre Dame. And if he doesn't do that one little part of their he has to pull a Brian Kelly and change the entire culture of the basketball program, including his recruiting and I know that you have felt in the past after the Kentucky season where they lost Kentucky in the elite at he was thinking about like that's it if I they may if they would have made the final four and like that Luzon is my like, how do I want this to end? Well, this is not how we wanted to know nobody. You're thinking about a potential end five years ago. It's still there now and this has been incredibly frustrating. I don't think he doesn't have to be fired. I think that if he won't he won't get far. He's not careful. He would get the we get the more break. All right, here's the deal. We're going to make these changes and he's either going to say it, you know, and it's just gonna say no Tyrone, Willingham. Lost their there were reasons why Tyrone Willingham lost his job. After three years. One of them was they were recruiting so god-awful poorly and that's where Mike Brey is right now. I mean Mike brace recruiting his recruiting territory South Bend. What are we doing? We lost someone no, I just, you know, I wrote a story in December and said that the program was broken. They rallied against Bad competition, but they but they played well, there's there's no doubt that he got them playing the type of basketball that we thought they were capable of playing a little bit earlier. I think it's so fragile the situation that had they beaten wake in Florida State. There's not a chance that I would believe this or have a thought any reason to believe any reason to believe this I would thought you know what he got them all the way back. He wants that one more year. I don't think he wants one more year. I don't think Mike Brey wants to but I agree with you not after what happened. It's after what happened with Wake Forest in Florida State. I don't think that he felt that a week ago. I don't but I don't think he's going I don't think it's something you just like go back on either. I think the exasperated feeling of it's not going to get better. He's doesn't it? Look I really like Mike Brey and I've been open about how they're not recruiting. Right and graduate transfers have to come in. I can't believe one didn't come in this past year, but how they absolutely have to have to because of the recruiting whole you cannot and this is a true statement. He made nobody asked him about the talent level. Postgame in a two minute and 45 seconds press conference. But when he just said there are 15 NBA Scouts here and they weren't here to see any of our guys. He's not a first-year coach the like you should get guys here I said this to reporters walking out and somebody actually said to me well, they can't get those guys Notre Dame. How do you think they got to the Elite 8? Yep Zach Auguste? Demetrius just act August I start with because he has been way more than the a talent that anybody has been recruited. And since Zach Auguste Demetrius Jackson General Grant Pat connaughton. I know that some of those guys aren't making it in the enve Bonzi Coulson met Farrell their Fringe NBA except for connaughton, but their NBA level Player NBA level type players is no does expansion team. They'd be on it. It's the way to look at it. Steve a story is a high-level European player. He's a he is an obvious professional basketball player even VJ beachem. That's he was reprimanded. Figure shooter and he was a he's a professional basketball player right now. Mooney is a professional basketball player. Gibbs isn't up will be probably because it could do to improve but no one is thinking NBA her practice Hub. You're thinking MBA for Demetrius Jackson. Yeah, I'm Sharon Grant. I mean he has recruited players to hear. I don't know why it stopped. I don't know why you would want to make that statement. That's if that's something that's not that it can't be made after that gave me. What are you talking about? What it's totally on you that you don't have anybody like that resemble. The kitty said Rama breakfast. The Wake Forest game that my big sin plenty defense like that. If Brian Kelly said that after a game, oh my God, he would get destroyed destroyed. I couldn't believe he said it and he said it in the typical Mike Brey way that I love these guys. He followed up with that. Yeah, my guys when I don't have any NBA players, but it's you got to recruit the NBA players and he has done he's done his whole career records played in the NBA. He isn't a Litany of NBA guys the J equally Jack Coulee play the NBA back. Carol was a solid in the eighth. Player. Luke are going to make it to the NBA. He got been Hansbrough to come in. He was a friend player. Like there's plenty of guys the kissing his heart is not in it the way it was losing does that I realize that but you know, they've got they've got to go to the NIT, right? You can tell they will-they. I think he I he'll go the NIT they could if they actually Focus the way they've been playing they can win a couple of when if you want because I mean, they'll be playing the still play. They're still playing good basketball. They just blew a lead against one state to another and they they were they were the better team. Team most of the night. Yes, they they have their were the better team for 36 minutes. But I what you said about like, it just doesn't feel like the hearts in it anymore. That's the vibe that I get and certainly next season man. You can feel like the floor completely dropping out the reinvention of an absolutely grad student you I mean Grand transfer you have to get you have to wait you have to get to grad students. They're in your top six rotation 7 rotation top seven rotation you do. They don't necessarily both have star. No. I'm not saying you bring it they have pieces but you need more pieces because he didn't there's not a scholarship. So some other coach John beilein somebody who's older. I'm not sure there but he's a great that's a great college basketball cause I don't know who up-and-coming coach they might get but John beilein is a better coach for the next five years in that guy. There's no done. No, there's no right. There's no doubt and I he'd be Great fit for Notre Dame. He would immediately give them credibility and I they would be a better coach basketball team a lot better coach basketball team than they are right now. There's just it's about the heart the heart is gone. And it's 20 years. It's a now nice round number. It's time for nor Dame to turn that page think Pete started broaching unfortunate Point here five years ago for it to end like this is never would have guessed that in a million about four years ago to Back a back-to-back Ely dates and then the next year. I mean they're contended for the the ACC tournament could have won the NCAA ACC tournament the next year. I know they lost in the second round. It was a really bad matchup with West Virginia because only one got a good dribble and West Virginia realized maybe we can stop him from getting the ball. But that was a good team to that was a really good team the third year The Lap of a story of senior year you could never imagine, you know, it really is falling off the table and just frightening way what? Yeah and the and the recruiting, you know. Like after the Elite 80 try to hit a home run with a couple guys and and right but but they didn't but you know the guys come in, right? Okay, you lose out on a guy like that. You've got to get the next wrong and they didn't like her had transfer again. You could get the level of Scott Martin to come in every year Notre Dame. Yeah be thought DJ Harvey was going to be a real player that killed them that it really hurts situation where yeah, they couldn't afford to absorb that it was one buyer class and he had lost and that really hurt Notre Dame because they just don't they have 11 they want He wants 10 or 11. I hate that mean we making jokes about a because they're going to have it again. But that was a bust in on the no player class, isn't it? You can't have another name either well and and and Ryan transferring and not because Ryan had the capabilities of being a prolific College shooter. Yeah, and they got they got notes for them. Right? They got no benefit out of that either so You know and we'll wrap up here to be in the elite to be in the elite eight back-to-back years into to basically piss away that opportunity after that is really really frustrating fairness. He got the result of that. He did get one really good class these current sophomore. Yeah just had some issues with with comedy being hurt and but they didn't have any help like you would like these soft first more if they had Juniors and seniors and grad students helping them right but I mean we can like you software's Wharf Isaiah Stewart was all The front porch and you're right. I mean there was a highly rated class, but I think we can all look back at that class and say okay, but fine was higher rate was higher rated than it really is going to be yes, but it was still a good like you recruit you recruited a good class in that one year. That was a good recruiting class. They'll be fine if he did every year it's so it's similar not the same to the 2016 defensive line recruiting class very good class, but they were asking the right way too much out of the gate as this sophomore class bath in basketball is being a Ask to do right now just it's too much and they don't they don't have help like it wasn't on. You've got to start. You've got to fill out your roster. You've got to have more bodies. You can't you can't say. Oh, well, we can't sign 13 players because they want to know who they're going to be sitting but everybody faces that situation. Yeah me ever and is probably I don't know what your help sport. I don't know what percentage of major college basketball teams have 13 full scholarships, but I know one thing that is 11 I know they ran out there all over the court on Wednesday night they all would have played at Notre Dame Florida State yes all right guys that's enough that's enough basketball and we'll buy the next one we may have something to report on that but that's it yeah no I mean as far as somebody leading the program but that's it for today where he nor name is on spring break they do not resume practice until not net what Tuesday of the following week next week so we got a little bit of a break here we'll have a podcast on shoot for Thursday of next week which is March 12th and until then Tim Priester Tim O'Malley Pete Sampson thanks for joining us thank you for listening to the Irish Illustrated Insider podcast if you enjoy our coverage of Notre Dame football please consider supporting the podcast with a small donation to Irish Illustrated.com slash support your support will help Irish Illustrated continue to be the leader and coverage of Notre Dame athletic
