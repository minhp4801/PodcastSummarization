Moans and groans moans and you and me. Moaning with you within you grunting as we breathe. Screams and Whispers as if leaves falling from the tree of life. You come and I feel the hands of God touching me. And I calm and you fall to your knees and prayer. Moans and groans the sounds of making love my breath is a fucking that you're not forget. Your breath the Breath of Life kissing my lips. You're breathing keeps me high. You make me high higher than the mountains kissing Skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain. Then you bring the Thunder for my loins. I sing when I moan screaming your name. Do it again. Do it again baby. Do me suck me. Fuck me open your mouth and let me in open my soul and find your home. Moaning and groaning just for you. I am a man. I am your man. The fool the deepest most sensual fool you're ever here. Begging to be the one to capture your release. your souls Captor your mind's master. In my mouth down my throat to my lungs you growl. Then I growl Primal needs and the sounds of making love. waterfalls and butterflies gentle winds before the storm With the noise from fucking I know the neighbors can hear me bad screeching walls buckling back-breaking crescendo. But only you will feel me. Moans moans moaning groaning screaming and then I grant your name my name no shame. No pain too. Great. I will not shut my mouth as I let go and Mom. and grown sing Oh, baby. baby, don't stop Don't hold back give it to me. Give it to me. Moved for me moon for me.
