At some point in time a bad spell of wet weather came over a Southern state flooding most of the many counties since the water was about six feet deep outside and inside their house one family spent its time sitting on the porch roof watching the wreckage Float by the young son happened to notice a nice Straw Hat as it went downstream. My he thought I'll bet that person who lost that hat is very sorry now after the Hat had floated out of sight. Around the corner of the house the boy kept on watching the river suddenly much to his surprise. Here comes the Hat floating Upstream against the current. This was obviously very strange. So the lad kept his eye on it. It floated Upstream around the corner of the house and came floating back down again after a while. It came back Upstream yet again rounding the corner of the house. Finally the boy couldn't stand it any longer and pointed out the Hat. To his mother asking whatever would cause such a site his mother replied. Oh, that's just your grandfather. He swore he'd take more than a few drops of rain to keep him from mowing the lawn today.
