I'm glad to have y'all so, you know right out the gate. I want to know how I felt to end 2019 with a big-time catch a big time play that ended up on ESPN man. How did that feel to end your year? Because y to me that would have ended my you out already know 2020 finna be amazing because X but no better way to end the year the ending it like you did. So tell me how you felt like that. You know, it was unbelievable overall. It was just a great game, you know, shout out to the teammates. It was just a it's a well-put-together game and you know the catch and the touchdown was awesome. Don't get me wrong. But and in the end of the year on a win and winning that Bowl game was it was it was something special man. So, you know the gate the catch itself is awesome. But coming out with a win was is the more important to be honest. I like that. I like that team player baby team player, but I'm Gonna Shine play. That play was awesome. It was that it made it made it for a reason. They can't have bacon and slice and dice baby that a I talk for you Wyoming. He being a team player, but the play was on top on point every way you look at it. He did his thing and everybody else that was in that play as well now man. I asked for with your dad through DM's on Twitter and then he just Tell me about your mind. Oh, I got it. I got it here from this guy. Cuz this story right here. I got the here. So your dad was laying it out for me, but I want to hear it from you because I know it's going to be powerful man. So just just can't take me back to where it started to now and I won't hear it all man. Okay. Yeah for sure. So started out will start out in high school started out loving High School in Colorado. You know, we played we played And for a football and back in the day, you know, I was a quarterback just kind of going through the recruiting process, you know, not getting a bunch of huge looks or anything. You know, I knew that there was a chance that I would be playing a different position other than quarterback as well. So, you know, I was kind of open anything, you know happening at the next level. I just really just want an opportunity. You know, I had a couple smaller schools. I'm from Colorado kind of you know interested in talking to me, but I'll tell you one thing, you know coach coach Cooper. He was my recruiting guy from Wyoming and Coach Grant the wide receiver coach here. You know, they would call me every single weekend starting my junior year and you know, call me whether it was that, you know, two o'clock in the afternoon, or if it was, you know, 10 or 11 o'clock at night and you know, they talk to me about football what's going on in life. You know anything like that and so it really it really made sense for me to come here. You know, they gave me a preferred walk-on spot. So, you know, I went ahead and took that right away and right away. They said, you know, you're going to be playing receiver not quarterback. So, you know, obviously like I said, I was open to that just any opportunities is really what I wanted and then about think it was after about a year and a half or two years. You know here at Wyoming kind of going through it all, you know Scout team Redshirt Year all that. They ended up, you know giving me a scholarship to play football here which was unbelievable. And you know, since then it's been wide receiver special teams, and I played a little Wildcat, you know this last year whatever and we ended up scoring a we scored a little touchdown off the read option. So that was kind of cool, too. But yeah, you know, it's kind of been all over the place and I'm just really grateful for getting the opportunity to come here at Wyoming and you know kind of prove myself man. How do you feel when you got the scholarship? Like did you make probably cried? I know you cry like a little bit pulled me into the office and was talking to me. You know coach Boyle is a great great coach. Head coach and he gives it to you straight or whatever. So I love that about him too. But what really got me is when I ended up calling my parents right after I got out of his office or whatever and told them and you know, they were both they were both bawling and everything. So that's that's kind of when it started to hit the heart a little bit and that's when I start to get a little emotional. But yeah, it was awesome. It was unbelievable man. You can't beat that cuz when you leave school you too much. I ain't got to pay that much back. Act like you do you think that's the main thing? You ain't got to pay too much Batman. So you already start not winning. Yes, sir. What are you don't get your degree in I'm gonna get it in finance big time. That's definitely. Hey, you got to know about money period hands down. So you ahead of the game already. Yeah. That's that was my thought process, you know, money's always going to be around and you know scared money don't make money. So that's that's why I trust Finance There are you gonna win either way life and football period is going down. So how how do you feel about the Spring ball when it started rock and roll it was already rock and roll and then on top of that you got summer then you got the season coming. How do you feel about it? I feel great. You know, we've been we've been going through winter workouts ever since we got back from Christmas break. We've got a couple of quarters. Max here that can really throw the ball and can lead the offense. So we've been working with them, you know every single day run routes figuring out checks talking to each other about you know, what we see what they see, you know, trying to get out get everyone on the same page and you know as a team, you know, we work out all the time morning. We do a big morning team run and then we always have our list kind of later on in the day kind of an afternoon or whatever and you know, I think everything's starting to come. Other and I think Spring ball is going to be the first sign of that. You know, we're looking good in the runs. We're looking fast. We're looking good in the weight room, you know looking strong. So I'm excited for spring ball, you know, everyone's going to come back out, you know, kind of get the rust off a little bit coaches are going to be able to see everybody but it's going to be an opportunity for the team to grow and get back on the same page and then you know, we got summer and that's, you know, just another opportunity for everyone just to get fast. You know build relationships, you know, that's when the Freshman the new Freshman Class comes in and you know, they kind of get adapted to the college Lifestyle the college workout. So, you know all that kind of stuff and then you know overall, you know, the final season man. That's that's something I'm really looking forward to right now, you know overall. I just want to start playing football again, you know sitting around and going going to a, you know, our team run or team lifts and school, you know, all that stuff is cool. But at the end of the day, I just want to play some football. Again, I feel you on that and a half now how you felt when you got in that Wildcat? I felt really good. You know, like I said, I played quarterback back in the day. So don't get me wrong. I still have a little bit of a king a little bit of a cannon you go out there saying something. Yeah, but you know, we're an option here and there back in high school. So I was pretty comfortable with, you know, being able to make reads and kind of kind of make plays so You know, I was really excited to get out there and you know kind of show what we can do as a team. And you know, like I said, it was pretty awesome to be able to score a touchdown off that, you know, all the offense of guys and the whole team, you know, I love that. So that's pretty cool. That's C. I'm of that might jump off him about my say one more thing to you. I hope that God allows this year for you man, just to shine bright because manual bone Pierre baller hands down then I ain't no use going wild. On top you doing walking. So it's in so many ways they can use you from Specialties the why can't the wide receiver to its so many ways that ball getting your hand and you can shake some God is just allowed in store for you man. And it be a season that you didn't even dream that you can have is just that amazing but my going jump off of him, man. Hey, man, I got a question and I'm trying to figure it out because I was looking up Wyoming I can figure out what a man's got they saying pokes all was it a cowboy? Yeah, it's where the Cowboys but, you know kind of like the short short version is pokes. Okay. Okay. So give us your you know inside look all the take of how you ended up choosing to go to Wyoming. Yeah, you know, I think it came down to you know, the childhood dream of always want to play D1, you know, a lot of there's a lot of controversy on if you should go to a smaller school and play right away or go to D1 and you know, try to shake something out and see what happens but you know as as kiddos want to play D1 was that was my overall goal, you know playing High School in High School playing High School football and everything like that. So You know once while me gave me an opportunity, I kind of jumped on it just because you know, the atmosphere here is unbelievable. I came up to a couple game day visits and the fans are unbelievable. And you know game day is just ridiculous. The fans are crazy. They're everywhere and they'll of Wyoming and no matter where you are in Wyoming, you know, whether it's a gas station a restaurant anywhere. You'll see someone wearing something Wyoming and you know, they'll give you a little go pokes or I'll see you be like, hey, like I know you and you know that kind of thing. So it's just a huge support system is really awesome to be part of nah, I was watching it was something like they were doing a tour of your facility and I was amazed man about the stadium the weight room. Everything look real top-notch or nice man. So I agree with you on that for how everything look I can only imagine how it looks and person. I wish I am a coal seam ochre make it out there for a live game. And because it look real nice man. Yes, sir. Yeah anytime if you guys ever get a chance not just let me know. Our facilities are crazy coachable. Like I said, he's a great coach and on top of that. He's a great businessman. You know, we just got a huge renovation like you're saying with all the facilities and they really aren't they really are Top Notch and it's unbelievable with the support that we get from like I said, you know Not only the fans but the boosters and everybody, you know, they make sure that we're treated nicely. So I really like that too. Hey, I got a question Kanye West got a house over there. Oh man have y'all ever try to go out there to it? We've heard about it. And we we've seen some pictures and stuff.

Going to the NFL football. You know after football, like I said, I've got a finance degree, but I'm really looking towards coaching from getting into it right away. You know, once I'm going to take footballs as far as you can take me and NFL's the dream and that's what I'm working towards and that's what I'm trying to get to but you know once footballs done with me, I'd really love to get back into coaching and you know, stay around the game because I just have a passion for it and I just would love to be able to help, you know other kids get to their dreams and goals, you know.
