Hi, this is Lynn Richardson. This is Walt talk. I'm so excited about talking to you about money. But not just money wealth means wisdom expansion assets. Love Theology and health because I believe that wealth is not just about how much money you have in your bank account. It's about establishing Harmony in your personal life your professional life spiritually emotionally your relationships and all that good stuff. I get so many questions from people as I travel the world helping.Some VIP. So this is our time for us to be together and for me to answer your questions. So here we go dear Lynn. I have been in a committed relationship for 15 years. We talked about marriage. He's actually more vocal about it than I am but it's a little frustrating when I see others getting married and starting their families. I promise I am genuinely happy for them. But I'm human and can only think when will it ever be my turn I just pray and ask God. what to do I don't want to
