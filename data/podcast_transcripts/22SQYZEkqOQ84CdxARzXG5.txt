You are listening to episode 21 of the simple Farmhouse Life podcast little Daniel. Let me lay him down. So he's I'm staring at him. He's there on the floor and he's giggling every once in a while and hopefully going to let me do this because he doesn't usually we'll see but in this episode I am going to talk about why we decided to buy an old house some of the questions that I get about buying an old house and some of the safety concerns and what to look for if you are thinking about purchasing an old house and then make sure to stay all the way to the end because I just started a new segment. This is the first episode that I'm doing it where I answer a random question from Instagram. My name is Lisa mom of six and creator of the blog and YouTube channel farmhouse on Boone join me as I share with you my love for creating a handmade home from scratch cooking and a little mom and entrepreneur Life along the way so Just moved into our 1890s Farmhouse a little over a year ago. It was January of 2019. It is now February of 2020. And before we lived in this one hundred and thirty year old house. We lived in a nearly 100 year old house that was built in the 1920s. And I also grew up in a 100 year old farm house. So I'm pretty familiar with living in old houses and I have a thing or two to share. When I was a kid my Dad burned down our old farmhouse. Now. The reason for that is just like with houses today. There are nice old houses and there are not nice old houses. The one I grew up in I lived there till I was 14 before my dad burn it down and built a new house. So I can't remember a lot to me. It was just home. It was fine. But here's a story to kind of illustrate a little bit about the house one time my mom. Went to check the Christmas tree water and we were all sitting in the living room and she went over and it was actually Frozen so that tells you a little bit about the insulation quality and that old house now, it did not have a electric furnace. My dad had to heat it with wood which we've always heated with wood. My dad still Heats with wood, but there wasn't even a backup. It was exclusively would so whenever we left for a vacation if it was in the wintertime we go. Go to Colorado almost every year he had to winterize the house to make sure that none of the pipes would freeze because there was no furnace that was going to be kicking on and saving that situation. Also. Another thing about that old house is the bathroom was an after thought. It was an old house. So there wasn't bathrooms whenever it was built. And so there was a bathroom on the back porch. It was not even in the main house. And so that's how I grew up and my dad. Had a very negative opinion of old houses. In fact, he's still pretty much does to this day because of that experience. You really can't blame the guy. So when we went to buy our 1920s Craftsman dad was definitely a little bit hesitant. Like I'm not sure why you would choose to purchase a old cold uncomfortable house and what we found that's when I started realizing that there's a difference between nice old houses and And junky old houses that shouldn't still be standing our first old house that we bought it was warm. Now. It was small. It definitely didn't have the insulation that they have today, but we weren't unable to keep it warm and I find the same thing for this house. Now whenever we went to purchase this Farmhouse, I actually put in the search terms in the criteria 100-plus, so I sought out an old house. And you might be asking why would you do that? Well to me, it's the cliche answer. You know what I'm going to say. It's the character. I cannot find in a new house just basic character of the house before you add any Decor. It's already magical to me. There's already these big tall Windows like in our new house. We have our new old house. We have a massive south-facing window. Go in the dining room. That is I don't even know how big I should probably have measured it before I said that's but it's a massive Square window that I really never see and I think they were very intentional about putting it there because it is a south facing window and it just pours in the light. If you are feeling gloomy, you can go in that room. I'm actually planning to push the dining room table up to it and start all of my seeds there because it has so much light and there is in every room of this. House and our last house, we don't even turn on a light during the day ever. You just just open the curtains and the whole house is flooded with light. It has that dreamy kind of light that I don't often see in a new house the windows is I think the first thing that I noticed another thing is all of the moldings and trim so whenever we walked through our last house and this one I'm instantly captured by Why all of this big thick moldings and crown molding and baseboards and the trim around the windows and the rosettes and even in this house there is some planking on the ceilings that is original. There is a curved staircase that is lined with beadboard going all the way up. There are heart Pine Floors, which is a wood that they don't even use anymore today and all of that stuff is so important to me now. This is the thing. Old houses for sure are not for everyone if that kind of thing doesn't get you excited. There are a few discomforts and concerns with living in an old house that aren't going to be worth it to you. Because if that doesn't capture your heart like it does mine then you might as well just get a new house because there are a lot of things about a new house that are definitely a little bit more comfortable. This house has excessively tall ceilings. It really makes no sense. It's more to Heat but I love it. It's worth the extra cost to me because it just feels so big. Another thing is old houses have a different kind of a floor plan modern houses have where your dining room living room and kitchen are all one big room and if that is what you're looking for getting an old house is definitely not going to be the best thing because you'll have to take out some structural walls that you know old houses didn't have That same kind of structural technology. I'm not an architect or anything like that. So I definitely don't know what I'm talking about. But I think there's a reason why there are open Concepts today and I didn't have them in the past. But that's actually something that I really love. I love the coziness of feeling like you're in this separate room. It's also really nice with kids because fluke and I want to talk in the kids are being loud. They can all go up the stairs into the bedrooms and we can close the French. URS in the kitchen and we can have that separation which I actually kind of appreciate mostly character. That's why I wanted an old house now. I also wanted a large lat I wanted some acreage. We live on Seven Acres and I find that old houses have more of that. This house was The Farmhouse on a really large farm now, they eventually sold off a lot of the farm and put some modern houses on it. But this seven acres here goes with the original Farmhouse and I find that. A lot of these really old houses have some property associated with them. This is arguable. So I don't I definitely wanted to get into any kind of controversial thing because I mean, you know old house over some people for some people they just aren't and that is totally fine. But some people say that old homes have better quality Old Wood Construction, so they're made with wood that was older that they don't have access to today. So it was a much stronger. Wood and they were really built to last hundreds of years. Whereas today houses are put up really quickly and they aren't really designed to last for hundreds of years there decided to do their purpose for people to live in them, but not to be around when people are talking about buying an old home from the 2000s. I love the pocket doors and our old house it is like I said the unique trim the the staircase the beadboard. All of those things just they get me excited as a lover of interior's but I am a Decor lover. This Aesthetics is something that I'm drawn to It's just in my personality to like that kind of thing. And so that is definitely worth a lot of the concerns that I'm going to talk about now. So what about asbestos I get this question a lot. Actually, I think I get more than anything else the question about lead paint and asbestos. So here my take on those. If you buy an old house, it's going to be there. It just is but as long as you don't disrupt it, and anyway, this is what I've done a lot of research on this you don't want to if there is an old linoleum floor and we made this mistake and our last house. Actually, you don't want to rip that out because there was probably a specialist underneath now laying a new floor on top of it keeping it more and more encapsulated. That's fine. But any time you mess with a lead paint or With asbestos, that's when it's begun to become friable. I believe is the word and you can breathe it in and get those negative symptoms associated with it. So for us lead paint isn't a problem because we aren't stripping anything now we did have a couple of doors stripped down to the bare wood, but we actually had that done professionally we brought that those doors and out of our house to someone else who does that for a living everything else. We are just painting over it. So There isn't any lead paint being exposed and brought into the environment. If anything, we're just covering it up more and more and that is what we do. I haven't actually tested for lead paint because I know it's there. I know it is. I just am cautious about anything peeling or chipping that is what you want to watch out for and I even had people mention this to me when I brought an antique into our house. That was a chippy old chair. And several people said wait a minute that probably has lead paint in it, and I hadn't thought about that. So even anything that you bring old into your house as long as it's not chipping you should be fine on the lead paint thing. Now, of course talk to a professional don't take my word for this but as long as something isn't peeling away and you just encapsulate it it's not going to affect Health negatively. So we don't worry about lead paint. We don't worry about asbestos, but we also aren't ripping out walls. We aren't stripping and Any paint off we aren't ripping up any floor our house already had all the floor was just the original wood. Now we did have it sanded down but we had professionals do that again because there was there was paint on the upstairs floors, but we weren't living here. We had professionals do it before we came in. So if it had led on it, we didn't deal with that at all. So it's something to be cautious about but really only if you're going to be doing a massive renovation that is going to require you to be ripping things out. In stripping things in really getting into it. And so when we bought this house one of the main criteria that I was looking for was a house that didn't need a lot of work. I know that if you watch my videos you probably think wait what but really it didn't we had all the floors refinished by a professional we had all of the walls and trim painted because it was already painted the color and so we just made it all white to unify it and the only thing we did that was kind of big was ripped out the cabinets and redid the kitchen, but we did not buy a house that needed massive massive renovation. We paid a little bit more because this is our second house. We kind of already went through the starter house phase of our lives and did a house that is old but yet has already had a lot of those things updated so that brings me to another Point electrical and plumbing a lot of times when you're buying a house. That's 130 years old sometime over the last 130 years somebody else some previous owner. Has already done the work of revamping and redoing electrical and plumbing. So that's something you really want to look into. We didn't want a full-blown Fixer-Upper this time around we didn't want to be redoing all of these things because we just didn't want to get into that much stuff. So we were looking for a house that had a lot of that already done. The other thing people ask me a lot about is the windows. Do you need to replace the windows? In fact whenever we were selling our last house we had so many people walking through that were like, oh well, we'd have to redo the windows. And this is a Hot Topic among old house lovers because old windows are actually made to be repairable and new windows the new kind that you could just go into lows and by they are meant to last 20 30 years. So by the time the Energy savings has actually paid off its time to replace windows again, you could just reglaze and redo the old windows. So we had no intention of replacing our gorgeous old. They are so much prettier than the new windows. We just put in our kitchen when we added a window. I didn't even realize how much prettier they were until I just randomly bought some windows to put in the hole that we made in our kitchen for the new windows to add a little extra light. They are so much prettier. I feel like a lot of the character of an old house. I can't even put my finger on until I see it not there and seeing these new windows next to the old ones. No never replacing my old windows. Yes. This house is a little bit expensive to heat but it does have lots of layers lad and plaster and people have added things over the years and it really isn't bad. Our furnace really can keep up completely with the outside Temp and we do enjoy 70 degrees in here. Actually. We put it more like on 68 because we're cheap but definitely does keep the house warm. It stays warm, even though we have old. Was and we have no intention of getting rid of those pretty things. We do plan to revamp. The chimney. This house hasn't had a functioning chimney and I don't even know how many years the last owners capped it and never used it and we plan to get that back in working order and get a wood stove going in here so we can kind of ease the cost of heating This Old House, but we are warm and toasty and it has a central unit and it does the same for air conditioning and it's nice and cool in the summer and it does stay comfortable. So all of that to be said why wouldn't you buy an old house? Well one would be its if you couldn't care less about Aesthetics and you're just looking for a nice simple home that will be easy to heat and easy to cool which like I said ours does stay hot and cold but it does cost a lot more than a modern-day house would cost to heat and cool. Also if you don't want to live through He kind of renovation now this house. Like I said did not require ripping down walls or anything like that or anything massive. We did have some aesthetic things. We wanted to change and we still have more so our kit our bathrooms aren't in any are there in working order but they're not pretty and that is something that we're going to have to eventually live through another renovation. I'm okay with that because I like putting my own stamp on it. I'm kind of weird in that I don't like when I house has already had extensive Renovations done. So this house was a score for me because nobody had really touched it. It just kind of had been left as it was and so I could come in and not worry about ripping out a almost brand new kitchen because it wasn't it was done in the 80s or something like that. It was done a while ago, but I've had I bought an old house that had already been all done up by a person like me like in 10 years how this house is going to look I wouldn't have liked that because I like Being able to design and think through what I want the house to look like that's all fun for me, but that's not fun for you. That's not your personality. I'll give you an example my own parents and my sister. None of them are old house lovers. They don't they don't speak to them all they see those as a project and a burden and so they wouldn't buy an old house at all. So the old houses are for them and I think that all comes back to knowing your personality types. So when my dad tried to discourage us from buying an old house, I think maybe he didn't realize how how much I love them and how much when I walk around my house seeing the character is really important to me. I love that that is all part of the creativity for me. But if it's not you then I wouldn't buy one. There's there's no reason to buy an old house and less that old charm speaks. You and you just really feel excited about making an old house your home, but those are some of the things to look for if you are wanting one that isn't a complete Fixer-Upper, make sure to get two inspections make sure that you don't have to completely update plumbing and all of those big things make sure the foundation is good and that the house isn't falling in a lot of times. These old houses were built to stand and they've already done their shifting whenever I was talking to some Foundation guys. That was a lot of what they were saying. In all houses shift all foundations do shipped. It's just that when you earn an old house, it's already done the shifting but make sure it hasn't shifted in a way that your house isn't structurally sound that's important. Don't skimp on inspections. They cost a lot up front. I think we spent thousands of dollars on inspections on a house that we may not even by if they didn't turn out right, but that just gives you that peace of mind knowing that you're going into a purchase getting all the information and knowing You're up against if you don't want to live through a renovation, make sure you know that going in be realistic about it because every renovation costs double and takes twice as the amount of time as you think it will and so make sure you've counted the cost and you really want it. All right? Well, there's my experience with living in an old house buying old houses. We bought two of them. We've sold one and we've had a great experience, but it's just something that I love and so I will take the extra inconvenience of living through. Russians in order to have my pretty old wavy hard to open painted shut Windows. Yes. There are quirks of old houses. I will have my squeaky floors and my layout upstairs that has absolutely no closets at all all for the aesthetic but that is my thing and I will Overlook a lot of inconvenience has to have it. So another example is you know, I have an old stove. My husband looked at me like I was crazy. Are we buying a 1949 stove? Because when I walk in and I see that thing I don't care if I have to light a match to make the oven go. It is something I love and I will deal with a little bit of inconvenience to enjoy the aesthetic benefits of seeing my pretty stove. Okay. And for today's random question, I did a question box over on my Instagram stories. I had so many good ones. Probably enough to keep me going for like Fifty episodes. But whenever I get through them I will end up doing this again and getting some more so I'm just going to pick a random one. They're just all over the place. But someone asked what car do you have? I thought this was a good one because as a mom of six, this was something that we struggle with whenever I was pregnant. We had a Dodge Caravan before that seat seven people all maxed out and Daniel was going to make number eight of the family, of course, and we looked into getting one of them. Massive what we call homeschool vans. So the big white vans that have like 15 passengers, but I just did not want to go there. I was just against it. I didn't want to be driving around a bus because our family likes to go in a lot of family adventure days like tomorrow, for example, we are going to get up early have breakfast and then we're going to go somewhere far away. My husband loves hikes and so he is constantly researching different state parks and different Trikes and trailheads we Do this all the time and while we're and the town, we usually like a different town. We will usually get coffee. I'll go to some antique shops we go to Parks. It's just really fun. We probably do that a couple times a month and I just feel like I don't want to drive this massive vehicle all over the place if we don't have to and so I just wanted to get something that seated exactly eight. I looked at a lot of options. We ended up deciding on a Honda Odyssey. Now you all know our commitment to debt freedom. I talked about this in the past. Cast episode so we do not get a brand new Honda Odyssey. We got a 2016 and it has been perfect for us. Now. Of course people say well what if you have a seventh? Well, I don't know if we'll have seven but if we do, I will cross that bridge when we get there at least for two years. We're not going to have to drive around the massive van. Alright, well, thank you so much for listening. If you have any more questions about old house ownership anything I didn't address send me a DM DM on Graham I like to get those kind of things because I remember what it is that people want to hear and what I'm missing. Thank you so much for listening to this episode of the simple Farmhouse Life podcast, and I will see you in episode 22
