Hello and welcome back to practicing human the podcast where every day we're getting a little better at life. I am your host Corey mascara and in today's episode. I'm going to share a few thoughts on the idea of finding meaning more to come on that in a moment. But first let's settle in with the sound of the Bells. Finding your life's meaning is one of those things that can feel daunting and or just too big to tackle that some people have a seem to have a natural sense of their life's purpose and meaning and other people tend to develop this over time. But a lot of people may never feel like they come to one grand overarching perceived meaning for their life, and I think People put pressure on themselves to find this or to feel like there's a sense of things being incomplete until I know what my purpose is and what my meaning is and if that's important to you and maybe if you found that I think that's great, but I don't actually think we need to have one core thing that is inspiring all of our actions instead of trying to find your life's meaning. My invitation to you for this episode is to explore creating meaningful moments throughout your day as you're living your life Moment by moment. He periodically might ask how can I make this moment more meaningful or how might I perceive a sense of meaning in this moment. You can see what arises around that and then see how it inspires action in your life. If you have some overarching Central meaning or sense. Purpose that you live by and that's great and you can keep that in you can allow that to inform how you live your moments. But if you haven't found that that's okay too instead, you might work on creating meaning Moment by moment and after doing this for a while, you'll have more meaningful moments in your life. Give this some thought and see what it's like to integrate into your day. As always. Thank you for your practice. I'll talk to you soon and take care.
