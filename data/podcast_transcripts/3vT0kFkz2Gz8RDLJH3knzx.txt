You are listening to do includes live podcast with a McMillan and Becky Ward where we talk about doing your 20s in the 2020s. Hi guys. Thank you for joining us for our first ever episode of doing quarterly podcast. And this week. We are celebrating women. I'll is international Women's Day on Sunday the 8th of March, so we thought it'd be a good opening topic as two female podcast. Has Amy what could stuff have you heard in the news this week? Okay, so I know in a moment you're going to be talking about a really huge piece of news that was covered in the media last week. So I thought it might be nice for me to start with maybe a slightly smaller you story that people haven't necessarily heard about and I was scrolling through Twitter last week and stumbled across an article about hair salons and basically a number of salons across the UK have been boycotting gossip magazines. And it was just a story that really stuck with me. I think especially in light of the recent Caroline Flack suicide which really shocked and upset a lot of people and it was really nice to see that consumers or certain consumers have been taking responsibility and also taking action and to ensure this kind of thing doesn't happen again and even when it's on a small scale like this, I just think it's so important that we do. Actually take action after tragic incidents like this. We don't just you know, feel the pain and then just carry on as as we were. Yeah, I saw that in the news this week actually and I sent it to my auntie because she's a hairdresser and this is something that I never would have thought of but it's actually acknowledging that you're not going to buy into the bullshit anymore and Danny Cipriani. I don't know if you saw his video on Instagram. I am with a related to Caroline Flagstaff. So I think they actually dated which I didn't know but he's a rugby player and he did a really long live video on Instagram the other week and a big part of his message was basically we can't really say in this case that it was like the bad media because it's kind of it's not really them and us it's just us because the media doesn't exist without I can see him a basis to fund it and if bad stuff didn't sell then they wouldn't print it. So he was just basically calling for a more longer lasting affection because obviously everyone was sharing the hashtag be caught and and he uses the analogy of some women on think he said he was in Richmond. I might be wrong. I don't know if it's that there was a there was a bad sexual assault in that an area of London and for a while women avoided this area maybe. For like a few weeks, but then gradually you'd see more and more women back on there again and his point was everything has a reaction for like a small period of time. But if we actually don't want this stuff to keep happening then we need to like Implement things. That means like things are actually changing more permanently. And I think what you said about something like a hair salon not buying into that is so important because also it's just like the culture when you go into a salon to chat about things and you don't want to be chatting about Like negative things with someone else's life and if they're putting like positive books on their shelves then I think that's amazing. I think it's also recognizing that it's not just words on a page actually that influences the people that they're talking about the whole time like what Caroline Flack been through was in saying with the media attention and what she did. Yeah, and I'm very happy that we are starting to see some change. Now onto my thing in the news this week, this is actually a really heavy one for our General brand of podcasts. And but yeah, it was Harvey Weinstein getting found guilty on two counts in the Routan me to related trials and obviously I think it's easy to look at this and think. Oh, well, that was an expected outcome because it's been so all over the media and we're all very much on board with the idea that with the amount of just like the volume of Women that come forward and with claims about him. It's got to be true like no smoke without fire but actually proving something like this in a core is actually really difficult and I didn't actually realize how difficult it was in terms of because I didn't know anything about the victim statements or anything and then listening about what went on in the trial of they were it was actually really complicated because the two key witnesses that had one of them had a rape Charge against Harvey Weinstein and another one had serious sexual assault charge against Harvey Weinstein, but both of them had engaged in both consensual and non-consensual sex both prior to during and after the whole thing. So it was going to be very difficult for a jury to feel adamant that it was definitely unconventional sexual acts and then they also had women on the track. In the trial that couldn't really have those kind of charges against him purely because they happen too long ago and things like that, but they were testifying to show that there's a pattern of behavior. So that was the third Camp. He was actually found innocent and that that would have secured him being in prison for the rest of his life. We don't know how long he's gonna go to prison for yet. They haven't done the sentencing but the reason why this is so great is because it's starting to like force people to rethink how they think about sexual violence how it can be complicated how things can be consensual and unconcerned to and still be wrong because I think people struggle with that with like if you have a husband who Forces himself on you. It can be very confusing for someone not involved in that so that was so good. But another reason why it was so good is because the prosecution were basically arguing this is proof that meteor has gone too far. So had he not been found guilty. That would have been supporting the claim that meters gone too far. They're sort of like on a which harm. Yeah, so big wins all around Hopefully he'll get an adequate sentencing soon. Yeah, I think also the kind of long-term effects that I will have in Hollywood and in kind of like, you know, the entertainment industry in general it shakes the power and balance. I think I think they're hopefully if there are men in really kind of big positions of power now, they aren't going to feel that they can get away with this same kind of awful Behavior. And that you know people will start calling them out. So I just think hopefully that will see such a kind of shift with the entertainment industry now. Oh, yeah, it was huge. Like it doesn't really get much bigger than Harvey Weinstein in Hollywood. He worked on Pulp Fiction. He worked on Kill Bill. He worked on Django Unchained like all the big films you can think of he was there and the saddest thing about all of this is that most of his victims or maybe even all of them. I don't know enough about all their cases. But most of his victims it seems were people really trying to make it in the industry and it's the sad reality of the fact that people exploit women who are lower down in the food chain in Hollywood and all the women want is to have good connections with people who are higher up and they exploit that but now we've finally finished with our news. I promise it won't always go on that long, but that was it that was that was a big one. That was a big one that we felt was important to sort of Linger on a little bit mean to you. Okay. So what does feminism that mean to me? Well, I think aside from equal opportunities and equal rights, I think for me more than anything it's about choice and I think a common misconception of feminism is that To be a feminist. There's like a certain set of rules that you have to follow and there's certain ways. You can't behave certain things you can't do and actually for me. It's just about opening up Choice. Like I know that if if I want to settle down and have seven children, then I can but if I want to live life single and independent and grow old with you, no, no man. No children. That's also absolutely fine. You know if I want to wear a full face of makeup and go out in a top that shows off my boobs. That's cool. If I want to go out and like a baggy hoodie and that's also fine. I think it's just about having that choice for me. That is so important. And and also I think that something that I really love about feminism is that it really is a movement for everyone. I think regardless of Kind of sex gender sexuality race religion, I think for feminism not to benefit or areas of society. It would completely defeat the purpose. But actually it does benefit men. It benefits everyone and I think feminism when it's being done right should lift up the voices of particularly transgender women black women, you know Muslim would women Etc. So yeah, I think That's why it's so important because it really does affect everybody. Yeah, what you were saying about choice. I know Emma Watson said that before that that's how she how she views feminism and she was talking about it in relation to her role in Little Women. Have you seen the new nice? I haven't I do want to work. Yeah, but in the new Little Women the role that she plays is actually sort of what would be considered a really traditional female role. She sort of gets married. And as the whole family life and everything like that and her sister and main character Joe who's played by Saoirse Ronan, Joe goes off. She's doesn't want to get married. She pretty much turns down the loved like she's not interested in men. She wants to pursue a career as a writer and she can't understand why her sister isn't doing the same and Emma Watson's character says she says just because my desires are different to yours doesn't mean that unimportant and it's just the idea that there isn't her her starting that family life wasn't her not being a feminist. It was her doing the thing that she wanted to do with her life. So yeah, I think I agree that that was definitely a misconception with feminism because you definitely and I think feminism for a long time was considered such a dirty word. Oh, yeah 100 by then. I think when we were definitely even at school If you would talk about being a feminist it was because it was like, oh I roll. Yeah, she's a feminist. She has this bizarre view in that men and women should be equal but like it was like but bar bra-burning that stung just Barbara bra burning like crazy with it, basically. Yeah, but I think it wasn't even necessarily seen by a lot of people as you know, just an equal opportunities thing. I think it was seen as like some man. Hating movement. Yeah, which of course is and but I remember I remember even being at school and being in a philosophy and ethics class and our teacher was we would on the topic of gender and how women are treated in society and I remember getting quite passionate about it and like voicing how I fell on on the topic and my teacher said like what you just said is a feminist stance like you have a feminist Viewpoint and I by being so embarrassed and like everyone in the classroom kind of like snickering and looking at me weird and like I found that embarrassing at the time and I think it's like such a credit to the progress that has been made that actually now that isn't something that a majority of girls would feel embarrassed about and in fact, I think a lot of women wear that badge really proudly now. Oh, yeah for sure like it's been But it's not some groundbreaking thing. It's just something that everyone should want all parts of society should one and I think for a long time I didn't really know enough. I didn't even know enough about how exactly the world was shaped to disadvantage me until so much probably only in the last couple of years, which is crazy. But I think I think when you're at school, you're not push to think about it like the curriculum doesn't cover. Things like that on the hull and it's also kind of not cool to be thinking about that stuff either. I think one of the first triggers for me was when I was in my third year of University. It was actually crazy late and I did a feminist philosophy module and it was it was the first time where I was really sat down and forced to think about it. I think nothing really put it as clearly A for me and ironically say as Renegade Lords. I don't really add a lunches while no longer talking to white people about race and I know obviously the entire book is explaining how let it's busy explaining explaining structural racism, but I found it a really interesting way to look at being a woman as well because a lot of what she talks about in terms of white privilege is also male privilege to basically explains. What a privilege as something as white privilege is an absence of prejudice sort of an absence of obstacles in your life that are going to affect things like your career. Your prospects basically everything like that. And then when I saw White Privilege in that way, I got to understand the same privilege of male privilege because if you think about it, if the same people same group of people and making all the laws and make it our all the CEOs of every company if the same group of people and the top of every basically pillar and Society then you're never going to be considered in sort of the laws they put in place and things like that and then you know, Actually going to be on the back foot obviously goes without saying that women are on the back foot seeing as the amount of compare campaigning the word on prior to my billboard. But yeah, I think I think really understanding sort of structural structurally how women disadvantage is really important. Like it's so much more than just just getting cat called and Street. Yeah, it goes far beyond that and I think for a long time that's the only part of it. I really understood like I understood the object objectification side of it, but I didn't understand how it could affect my prospects. So yeah, and I think as a whole But I'm actually like when a bit nerdy than this, I brought a whole list of like things that I could think of of ways in which I think women are disadvantaged right now and it came I could like almost put two sub headings on everything and one of them was an undervalue. I like not valuing women and another one was under representation, right so valuing for me. a explains domestic violence explains Objectification explains not being able to look dress whatever. However the hell you want explains a lot of stuff in Saudi Arabia right now and all that side of it, but then under-representation explains sort of like you're not seeing women in music festivals. You're not seeing women in like winning best directors. I think living in history books in history books. Oh When we went to see Lucy McCormick, this is McCormick and Edinburgh Fringe. Yes. I am, you know, whatever friends last summer, but there was this crazy piece actually really worth seeing I don't I have no idea who's in the comics tilt or I've I've seen actually she I don't know if she's still doing shows but she was doing her. What was it called post post popular as popular she was performing it in SoHo theater. Yeah, there may still be tickets. But yeah if you if you're able Get your hands on tickets. I would strongly recommend it because it was I think probably like the standout thing. We saw Edinburgh, like obviously it was well recommended. I didn't go I didn't just find it. Yeah, it was recommended by the guardian and things and she's really got a name for herself now, but basically in the piece, she's telling women's history according to the history books and it is just a hilarious like but you just really get to see how lacking history books are a woman and then have funny the ones that have been included. Yeah and how simplifies their stories are and their mothers people have been in those books. I love the bit where others have a bit of a spoiler but it's not too much of a spoiler. So I think you can hear this but it's there's a bit halfway through where she just sits and eats an apple and drinks a can of Coke because she's Time because there's so little woman. Yeah, and she's just that they're facing the audience. Like I just had a lot of spare time because there's nothing that like and that was like probably the most political message in the whole thing. But yeah, that was a little side piece and then as a little special this week, I actually made a list of a couple of things that have happened good stuff for feminists since last International women's day. The first is that abortion has been legalized in Northern Ireland, which is just Bonkers that were still talking about this. Yeah, but obviously for Northern Ireland is a tricky one because they're traditionally like religious and all sorts of reasons for that is fighting the past is not actually come into effect yet. It comes into effect in April, but as it's been decriminalized the government are so far funding women, too. To England now, whereas before it was kind of your pain for yourself and it was very embarrassing and shameful and that's what's crazy about it because just because they were mostly guys didn't mean no one's getting abortions. They were just having a Gala way to do it. So yeah that is a massive Victory and now we can say the whole of UK has legalized abortion. And then the second thing that I found was changes the guardianship laws in In Saudi Arabia, I didn't actually know a lot about this but basically guardianship laws up until now have meant that women in Saudi Arabia can't leave the country without a male basically supervisor, right? So that might be their dad or there might be their partner, but now the law has been changed so that women over the age of 21 are allowed to acquire a passport and travel without a man which is obviously so important especially even So considering leaving. Yeah, and the the Bittersweet thing about it is even though they're starting to see some change. They still haven't released any of the women that they prosecuted for a for being active this so it's a bit ironic that they're now pass this thing, but the very woman that be an activist for it are still in prison. But yeah, I think that just puts into perspective the difference in some parts of the world. I think on that topic generally kids of today have it so much better in terms of the portrayal of feminism in the media and on social media. I think there's four one so many celebrities that kind of proudly Proclaim themselves as feminists now and it's including man as well. Yeah, including men and I think even like you can even go into Topshop or prior. Whoever and buy clothing that like says feminism. Yeah, I get seen as a branded fair and a differently now and I think some of the this is something like the coolest if you want to call them that and people that I follow on Instagram that is their whole thing. I know obviously that's my viewpoint. I followed them for that as well. But they're sort of like, they're not hidden away little weirdo. Is that like they're now in the mainstream Instagram social media Life, for example, I really like following Florence given. Yeah and sunflower sunflower is amazing. So obviously songs I wrote and what time to be alone. Yeah, which was such a refreshing book. I thought and it's not one of those ones where you can just have on the Shelf keep it looking at like a page at time every now and again, it just gives you that boost and then she's just written House get over boy, which I haven't actually seen yet. But yeah, so she's doing all good things first sort of female Independence and both of them. Actually they do. Things relating to sort of appearance. Yeah, obviously some tower started with hashtag secondary because matter it's very very important matter. And so she's like sort of like debunking the Perfection of what we see normally on social media, which actually usually drives me bonkers and same with Lawrence given hers is very much like she's just written a book women don't know you pretty which actually isn't out yet, but I have already pre-ordered it. I'm ready. But she talks a lot about obviously women don't know you pretty she's very massively into the whole debate about body hair. And I think that's a lot of what we see in the UK now is trying to push back on what's expected think that General sentiment of you know, it's actually probably more liberating and you have more freedom if you are now living as I a single woman rather than being kind of tied into a relationship. I think that message is really communicated. Like of course all types of media. Now, I remember like even at school the kind of songs, I would listen to and be things like Beyonce's cater to you or the boy is mine and it was always about you know, catering for a man or fighting over a man and you know a boyfriend being a kind of Indicator of like success or like status, whereas now you have songs by people like lizards. Oh who saying, you know, I only need myself and I you know, if I do have a relationship it's a benefit to what I have already, but I'm thriving and happy on my own and I feel like that's that kind of messaging was something that we didn't have. Yeah growing up on the topic of lizard and I think we can move on to are celebrating women. Yeah. and we basically put two people on social media who were the female Inspirations that they had and obviously this could mean anything from someone in the history books and it can be someone political could be someone in pop culture or anything like that, but I just took it for people that I really admire right now and my one of mine is Leslie the biggest reason she's on Is because I literally can't get enough of her music in terms of positivity and like like literally if I have a shit day, like I genuinely am boosted by this as music listen to her music and not feel empowered. Yeah. Yeah. I'm like hell yeah, I have I don't have a fucking clue one day but like I'm listening to lizard. I feel way better about not knowing what I'm doing now, and obviously that that was like where my love affair with her. Did but I think the more you see of her and like it's like how her on an Unapologetic infectious body confidence and she's I swear. I quote somewhere that said she's the shift away from a one-size-fits-all pop princess. Yeah, absolutely. So she does so much for body positivity in it's so rare to get a woman. That isn't One size in pop culture and also just for black women as well. So she's doing it for everyone and that's bloody marvelous and on a similar note. My other pop culture gal is Billy eilish very much for a similar reason is in that she's just so unpolished etic that she's almost rude, but absolutely bloody love her. Yeah, she Is basically kind of like symbolic of everything that people expect a woman to be she does the reverse and so it's like I know we're kind of past the super archaic seen but not heard women point of view. But the point is that was a point of view. It was important and she is so in your face and everything against that like literally her lyrics in bad guy. Make your mama sad type like yeah. She is like the amount like what you were just saying about the songs that we would have had growing up. We didn't have songs about women wearing men's lives. We had songs about men that were in women's lives and I think I love that sassy. Like I'm going to ruin your life attitude that she's got it's like a real shift in the power and I think it's like a great role model for younger teenagers to have. I think she's quite similar to Avril Lavigne. But the thing that I've Loved Enos you still cried a lot about men. Yeah, like she was rebellious, but she wasn't that rebellious. Yeah, it was more kind of Tied Up In Her Image rather than her like message through her song. Yeah, I think for me on the celebrity side of things one gal. The definitely Springs to mind would have to be jameela Jamil. I followed her I weigh movement on Instagram for quite a long time now, and I've always absolutely love. the sentiment behind it the page initially started off as a space for women and men and whoever wanted to join it for them to send him pictures of themselves with captions that kind of summarized what they weighed in terms of their achievements and their character rather than focusing on what they weighed on a scale and I really loved that concept because it meant that when I was scrolling through Instagram I was seeing seeing all these pictures of these amazing women with captions like I weigh raising four children or I weigh defeating cancer or I weigh running my own business and it was so refreshing because that's what you focus on rather than focusing on, you know, the body or the face and since then I weigh has kind of developed into this whole other thing and jameelah basically uses it as a space for All kinds of radical inclusivity. Yeah, and I think what you were saying about what you weigh in terms of achievement really makes me think about I don't know if you've seen it yet. But Taylor Swift recent documentary on Netflix Miss Americana basically in that there's one section where she talks about her battle with eating disorders and her appearance and things and it's just crazy how someone basically at the peak of their career. She was like in the back of the cabin the documentary and she sees a picture and she starts zooming in on the picture of herself. And then she looks like her and she's like no I don't do that anymore and she basically explains when whatever she'd see a pat for of herself or I made it like in the media or anything. She'd zoom in on saying like the tiniest bit of Podge on her stomach looks like the night and be so focused on it to the point where she was just starving herself and it's just so crazy. for some of them the outside point of view to see someone doing so well and in music and in life, but then for them to be thinking about the tiny bit of hardness now look like it's just absolutely because crazy and I think that's why it's so important to find people on social media that combat that like I have, you know in the past I followed so many kind of stereotypically perfect for my Instagram and like while you might not kind Of consciously be realizing how it affects you when you scroll through that like it does definitely damage your your kind of perception of yourself. And now I follow so many like body positive people and it affects the way I feel about myself. Like it makes me feel better. And then for another one of my Inspirations, this is actually a political one and I don't think you can really have an international women's day without mentioning her but obviously it's It's a dog. Mmm-hmm. And she basically put the planet urgency on the political agenda. She was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize and she was also nominated for well, probably a million other things but environmental reward of 40,000 dollars, which he actually rejected and said climate movement does not need any more Awards and I think what's so amazing about her is she is really getting the attention of ridiculously high up people even if they're still choosing to ignore her, but even I think obviously it's so depressing that Donald Trump has negative things to say about both climate change and her as a person but I think it's so hard to really grab someone's attention like that and she's done it so well, so obviously she has asked Burgess and I think I've read it really interesting articles around. I'll hurt her political campaigning cannot be separated from hospitals and it's kind of what makes her so obsessive but obviously in an absolutely brilliant way, but it's just amazing as well that she's showing people with Asperger's and things like that what can be achieved with the hard work with the things that they're focused on so, I think that's always something to like not ignore. So I think some people do I want to talk about it because they don't want it to be about her Asperger's but is about raspberries and I love that. She's she's literally inspired children all around the world much to Piers Morgan's dismay about staying off school for the sake of the climate. And I think it's so critical especially for the generation coming up because they're the ones living right now that going to feel the heaviest weight of it all. So yeah. She is a fabulous woman. I think finally it wouldn't really be right for me to talk about inspirational women without mentioning some of the women in my family and because they have definitely inspired me a lot throughout my life and as cliche as it sounds the first one would obviously have to be in my mom or jazza as she's known to many people and the reason she has been such an inspiration to me is because I have always seen her as such a strong businesswoman. She was always the main income earner of our household and I think generally as well. I've just never grown up around kind of stereotypical gendered roles in the house. I like my dad's always done the cleaning my mum's always kind of been like businesswoman. And yeah, she's just incredible. She set up her own consultancy business when she was made redundant quite a few years ago. And she's just incredible and I love her and and then also my to aunties and for again different reasons and one of my auntie's is a kind of really big family woman. She has two kids and she loves them completely unconditionally and she recently had to become a full-time carer for my cousin who was diagnosed with CRPS a couple years back and And that's been incredibly difficult for her in ways. I can't really even imagine that she has been so strong and so amazing at holding that families together. It's just given me a lot of respect and all for her and and then my other Auntie actually is a single woman and she doesn't have children, but she is one of the happiest loveliest most humble people. I know and I just respect how she's lived her life. She has given up years of her life at a time to go traveling around India, which I think is amazing and she's also dedicated her life her life's work to helping other people. She currently works as a speech therapist and works with disabled people to help them communicate better. So yeah, those are three women that I just definitely had to give a shout out. Yeah. I think that's like a really good example of what Saying about choices well because they're all obviously doing amazing, but in completely different ways like your auntie who's looking after your cousin went down the family room and your other Auntie doesn't have any children, so it's just like the different. Angles, I guess that you can go about life and still live in a really fulfilling. Yeah, he's still be serious happy and yet exactly fulfilled and whatever you do. Yeah, and I think like obviously same for me like I think most people's Inspirations or like woman that I look up to the first one that you look up to in your life is your woman is your woman it is it's your mom. Um and like honestly a little shout out because my mom just retired after many many many many years of working and that's obviously something that I'm proud of as a daughter having watched her slave labor and death rather than the years. So yeah, I think recognizing the women in your life that are close to you as well as the ones that you see in the media is like always Really important I think for me as well. Just just most my friends. Yeah, I think I think that solves the friends that didn't make the list but most of my friends are really inspiring but I just I just have real like weird surreal. I'll body experiences about some of my friends because I'm like I have days where I wake up. I'm like, oh my God, they are bloody amazing. Yeah, and I think Over the years definitely the last two years I've been so I've become such a girl's girl. Okay, there's nothing wrong with having plenty employment. It's like I still have plenty of boy mates, but I think I've got bonded so well while aging with the girls in my life, there is something so special and different about female friendship something I think especially because you can relate to each other in a way that I don't think you can necessarily relate with family or yeah, just someone that's A celebrity or anything like that? Yeah, and I think yeah just like so many of my girlfriends are doing such different things that I really admire whether it's like absolutely bossing their career or having made it through a ship thing or whatever like yeah. I have lots of inspiration for like hours. Finally. We're finishing all applicants with a little Arts chat just because Lana I'm like a massive consumerist in terms of art. Like I just don't stop like to the point where I actually need to just watch a pile of shit for once because I'm so focused on like watching really stimulating things all the time, but I think it'd be nice to include because like it's good to hear people's opinions on what's going on in the Arts world right now. I probably would have spoken about why I'm no longer talking to white people that race because that's actually the book. I'm literally just finished, but I've touched on that already, so I'll put We have a little chat about sex ed just because I'm ready. This is a really late like appreciation post for sex ed because it came out and start this year. But if you haven't watched in general you need to and if you have watched season 2 in and you'll understand exactly what I'm saying, but like I think like sex ed is such a revolution in I guess you can call it a TV series, even though it's just on Netflix, but it's just such a revolution because it's just so feel good. Yeah, and it's such an easy what and I was thinking about it and I was like I am just happier when I watch sex ed and I was thinking about why and this is going to sound like some crazy Bonkers psychology stuff, but it's so colorful like the costumes the don't know so that everything is so vibrant. And I know one of the things that really bothers people that have sex ed and wide Connor relate to it is that obviously it's a uk-based. Thing but the school looks quite American and aspects of it seemed quite merican and I think you can read that in different ways. But I think my reading of it is it supposed to be a bit like you don't know where you are. It's not supposed to be like, oh, I recognize that area or anything and but that makes it a more Universal. I feel like I know it's become really popular in America at the minute and I think it's nice to just have a generic Like is a bit trippy people have different accents. We don't really know what's going on. I think living in terms of like the time period like sometimes almost has a kind of like 80s for yeah, but I think that's when I can't lie when I first started watching it, I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to get on board with the whole kind of like americanisms that were like creeping in in the first episode. But actually I agree. I think the fact that it does have that Universal appeal. Yeah is what makes it really unique and Ready, like boys or show. I feel like I could write a dissertation about why sex ed is absolutely bloody marvelous, but I think like one of the best things about it is it actually is sex education like there's stuff that they talk about in season 2 and I'm just there like I didn't know that I didn't know that and I like it cup and I should have made a list to talk about this but it comes with so many different areas of like sex education from weird fetishes. to sexual assault to Like homosexual relationships and Body Image concerns and all sorts to the point where I'm like, oh my God, there is like 12 year old girls watching this. Yeah. That's what makes me happy. Yeah, young people now are watching shows like that. Whereas I think that's kind of information. We had to completely yes cover on our own but what's interesting about it is obviously the main premise of the show is there is a guy called, Otis. Literally sets up a sort of sex education clinic in his school inspired by everything. He's learned from his really invasive mum who is a sex therapist and like they're creeping around and going to this person in school. Like I feel like if there was a person in school who did set this up when we were at school the old when people go and asking questions, but I know yeah for sure we didn't have anyone to ask questions and we like sex ed was like literally Austin like I can't even describe the amount of ways I think sex education should have been done differently when we were at school. Like I think I think I had like I barely had to say so conversations and one was literally the biology of it. Yeah, and then another was watching someone give birth. Yeah, it's called even calendar sex essentially and then even like whenever we did have any sort of Education around sex it was so it was completely like heteronormative. There was no education for like game. People at school. I don't know. Yeah, definitely. That's what's so amazing about sex ed as well is like there's things that I wouldn't have thought of because obviously it doesn't concern me but it's like Christ. They don't actually know what to do. Yeah, and it's Bonkers and they're obviously going to do it. So why are we teaching it and just this whole like hush-hush is so unhealthy around all sorts of topics. Like I literally remember this is probably a topic. For another day, but I'll say it touched on it briefly. I literally remember my primary school experience was we had one sex ed class in Primary School in year 6 and that was just on period and for that class all boys had to be taken out of the ribs so that we could discuss period we had the exact same thing and I'm just like why are the boys weren't in the room? Why are they not understanding it from an early age? Why are they not saying it's something that's normal and not shameful. Why is it secretive? Why am I hiding my science? You tell in my bag like Actually, why is it not just out on my desk at work or like out on my table at school at why is it a bad thing? Because not a bad thing. Yeah, the be-all and end-all that conversation is sex ed is so bloody marvelous in so many ways and I think push past any weird out you now because I definitely had doubts Lisa and I think I think I was like solidly about halfway through season one until I actually started to be obsessed but But also I think what's what's really great about it is the fact that most school stuff I couldn't watch now because I'm past that period in my life, but that's what makes me realize that sex ed is more like a study of humans than School. Obviously it relates to school but it's so like it goes into each character so in-depth as Otis who's like so incredibly awkward in life and everyone can relate to that character in the world and like it's so Like if you look at skins or something, it's so much more about all we're going to this party and not and insects that is just Human Relationships. It's just I'm friends with this person. I'm dating this person. And that's something that you can get even now and I was like, oh, how am I going to watch a program about high school? And I'm not in high school anymore secondary school. I'm sorry. But yeah, so yeah, what I'm saying is I think that's just a prove how good the show is because the fact is that in the school and I'm past that age does not bother me. Whereas something like skins. I've tried to re-watch it. It's cringe. You can't really you can't because I just remember absolutely loving it. But I'm the same if I revisit it now, I'm just like yeah, but then you also compare that is what we had. Yeah, I so sex ed and the messages that skins gives in comparison to sex ed are so contrast. Yeah, like you get Fe she is like the girl you want to be and she is not. Okay. She is like off the rails like mentally. Yeah. Yeah, and she was like branded as like cool. Yeah, and it's just so Bonkers and then obviously like cook is the womanizer like it's all just like there's just so there's nothing to look up to in that program basically. Not that I'm saying it because I did love it then and I hold it very dearly in my heart. But I'm just saying what they have available. Now for teenagers growing up is so much better. But also we can't finish it without mentioning the fact the RuPaul's Drag Race season 12 has just started its first episode which is the other day. I am living my best life again. It's like strange now though because we've had the little like side side season of British. Yeah, and then go and getting back into the American now there's It's an old one, but it's definitely like yeah still my baby. Yeah, I love it so much and I think this season is already looking for a hopeful to me. So I think the standard even in the first episode was really high and usually there's like at least a couple I think I think like genuine gem genuinely RuPaul's Drag Race has inspired so many people and they like some of these Queens have been watching meeples drag race for a long time and it obviously going to get influenced by what they're saying. The bar is just getting like higher and higher and higher. Oh, yeah like that show has elevated dragon has elevated the expectations for drag now and it just shows how much of an art form it is as well like the costumes. I just can't I can't deal like the sewing technique. I think there's just so many different aspects that go into it. There's the looks and the makeup and the outfits, but then also you have to be So incredibly witty and on the mark, you have to be a good performer in terms of acting but also like Runo expects you to be a good dancer as well like those just so you have to be a person of so many talents to do really well on that show. See I've got massive respect for all the queens that have appeared on RuPaul. Yeah, and I think that's a nice end to this week's podcast.
