You are listening to Episode 22 of these simple Farmhouse Life podcast today. I'm going to be bringing on a friend of mine this woman and I met let's see here probably close to or right at ten years ago. It's hard to believe that now we always shared interest in all things Natural Health. All of that kind of thing usually is what we would talk about when we get together. She's since moved away and We've just kind of we haven't chatted in a while, but it was really great to record this episode. She has spent the last several years studying herbs. Actually, she was already pretty into it whenever I met her and she has spent all these years doing that. So she's going to share some of her knowledge of herbs and we had a really good discussion. I have to apologize that I have not figured out yet, which I need to do before I do this again how to get the audio really crisp and clear when having a guest on Know how to do it with my own little microphone in my own little studio if you will, but I will apologize but I didn't want to scrap the interview. So the audio isn't the best but I still think there's some value in the discussion. So I'm going to post it because we cover a lot of topics and go into some things that I learned quite a bit as well. So let's jump into the episode. So I am here with my friend Jen. Person have you told a little bit about yourself and your credentials and how you've been studying herbalism. And then I'm going to talk about how we met because that's fine. Sure. Sure. So I started really getting into things all the way back when are was having all her issues with like food intolerance and we were trying to figure out what was going on with your stomach issues and getting to the root of eliminating certain foods. And I think that's kind of a natural progression. A lot of people take is they Started looking at what they're eating and then our interest when they are just kind of grows in natural medicine or natural ways of doing things. So that's kind of what at my interest was piqued and using herbs that we were growing outside. And so I started studying with the absolute Institute, which is also called The First Institute or vepar th and I did my certification of Masters and herbalism through them. And that was back in 2014. And then from there I've worked with several Farms growing herbs and tea Farm moved out here and have a flower and teeth bar T company and I decided really what I love the most about doing that is working with my customers on a special glass or customizing things for their unique body type. Or what they're specifically looking for. So I went back to get more certification to be able to do clinical practice, which is something that I had done like herbal consultations and the United States is really kind of confusing as far as what certifications you need because there aren't any official certifying boards for our herbalism in the United States. So so you kind of have to just East You know the people who come to you need to kind of be aware of what different credentials mean. They just have to watch your language and what you're able to say or do so with the new certification that I'm finishing up. It will allow me to do clinical practice. It's a vitalist herbalist practitioners certification. So being able to work more one-on-one with people and doing herbal consultations. And so yeah, that's Kind of kind of the quick Reader's Digest version of what I've done since 2014. Okay. Yeah and you have tell us about your website because you sell tea Blends like you mentioned now, do you you do sell them direct to Consumer as well? Right? Yes. Yes. Okay, so I do I have my teeth locally, but I also have them online. My website is the Wildflower assist. Okay like Oklahoma. So the wildflowers is W IL D FL o wer IST the wildflowers ok.com. And then my Instagram is the underscore wild flowers. So that has all the links to my website as well, which I think is sometimes easier to find but my shop does have teased it has links for online herbal. Locations sometimes I'll pop up Little Flower things that I've got growing in the garden. I have surpluses flowers out there gone there and people will all drop Flowers by so my shop is always changing online what I've got. Yeah, and I remember whenever you used to live in our town the local coffee shop had your herbal tea Blends and those really okay. I will I just don't live there anymore either so I'm never there so they still do I love the rubis chai all we're at the park and she. Showing what all the different herbs were just that were just at the park. And yeah, we learned that plantain was good for bee stings and poison. Ivy, right? Yeah. Well, and now she's probably a teenager something but at the time she was like 5 so my goodness, of course she does. That's great. So I'm going to briefly share how I met Jen and then and then I'm going to go into a few things that you guys might be interested in as far as health concerns. And some of our own personal stories as moms and Howard's have helped. So I'm at generally randomly whenever I don't know if a lot of my readers or listeners know this but I used to have a website selling cloth diapers. So I was a retailer for cloth diapers and I was at a Baby Expo and Jenna was there. I think you were super pregnant with her second child. Yes. Yes, and you are maybe a little bit interested in cloth diapers, and then I ran into her in my town and I was like wait, you're the girl that I saw at the Expo. So yeah, we met very randomly, even though that wasn't in the same town, but then we turned it turned out. We live like a couple miles apart. So now we don't now we live hours apart, but We still shared interest in herbs and all things natural. So yes, yes. And you you briefly mentioned but a lot of people don't know about this but that your daughter had some Digestive and different food intolerance issues. And that's what got you into this. Do you want to share a little bit more about that? Sure. Well, we noticed that she had a lot of Xmas. So that was one thing that would flare up and we couldn't quite pinpoint what was causing that but she also is having pretty severe digestive issues. She would be chronically constipated to the point that she would like, you know claw the floor in pain. She would have so much pain from constipation. And so we went to frequently have to take her to the hospital have Animas like it was really really severe constipation and I just thought after the second time of taking this little like four year old kid who doesn't understand what's going on. To the hospital and having them pin her down and give her an enema that there had to be a better way. Yeah, I'm will help us invasive and just better overall for her and room for everyone involved. We're trying all of these things that people told us, you know, we relaxed and foods and we just find ourselves in the same spot like it would clear up for a while and then build up and be a big issue again. And so we started with the Almond milk and eggs, and then eventually we're able to add back in eggs, but she's been gluten and Melba free since I think she's about four or five. So it's been almost 10 years now and she has no stomach issues whatsoever anymore. She's the really, you know, healthy 13 year olds that I'm glad we finally found some routes for what was going on and excellent way to because great. I just think you maybe it was berries. Once we took those two goods out that cleared up as well. How did you use herbs to support or how did that get you into the herbalism? I know that helped you to just figure out the root cause of her issues that you you know weren't just I know you talked a little bit about treating symptoms and a lot of times moms go straight for the symptom and I guess in this case the symptom that you were treating would have been going and getting the enemas instead of figuring out. Okay? Why is she not actually? Yeah. Continued to every time she had a flair of treat the flare up, but it would have kept him going back because until we figured out what was setting it off in the first place, you know, but it never fully resolved. And and when you have an issue like that your nutrition is going to be affected the nutrients you're absorbing or is going to be affected. And so then it's gonna throw up other things too. You know how that continue to build it. Could become a much a much bigger issue than it ended up being because we finally figured out what was causing it the first place. I think that's why I was always kind of attracted to natural medicine. It is just I never was fully I was never fully convinced when we would go to the doctor for something that you know, okay, you're experiencing this. Here's a pill it'll get better. I just for whatever reason that never sat. Well with me I just wanted to know okay, but why lie Is it happening? And and that was what really drew me I think to natural medicine which has been filtered into herbal medicine, but just that practice of figuring out but wait, let's look at the whole body and figure out what's going on because symptoms really are just a language, you know, it's the language our body speaks to tell us something to give us Clues as to what's going on. And once we are able to look at the whole body instead of isolating out apart or so. We can bring the body back into balance which then in turn does get rid of the symptoms, you know, because it's pretty you know, it's bringing the body to place to support whatever the issue was to begin with. So the right Well, yeah, and sometimes I feel like we get rid of the symptoms, but that actually takes away. The one thing that was being our body, you know, like when you have a fever and it there's evidence that fevers actually do fight whatever is going on inside and then we get rid of it and it's something that was actually a defense of our body. Now, of course, they'll be disclaimers at the beginning of this that I'm not a doctor and so, you know, but that is just been my experience as a mom and then also meet Sleep when I get sick when the longer I can write it out. Try to stay hydrated and let my body do what it's trying to do. Yeah, it seems faster. We try to do the opposite and where every time a symptom comes out. We push it down. It really leads eventually to chronic illness or autoimmune disorders because the body starts to attack itself. I mean most autoimmune disorders at its root. What it does is the body is thinking that its own self is an allergen or something to attack and react to and so, you know, we'll find cases of people who really try to oh We germs at all costs because there's not anything that's actually naturally or normally triggering their body to have an immune system response like normal viruses normal colds with our bodies have those to fight. It doesn't attack itself, you know, but in the absence of very sterile environment and environment for kids to play in the dirt or in environments where kids didn't have any childhood diseases the body guided turns on itself and thinks it's an Invader. So it thinks that it Feel cold in your body. Does this do you have a wet cough or do you have a dry cough instead of just kind of saying oh you have a stomachache. I mean you can you can symptom treat with herbs the same way you can sometimes treat with medicine you have a stomachache. Let's drink peppermint or we need to you know, there's a flu bug going around. Let's take garlic and those things are fine to do here and there but if Stop and look at wait, where's the stomachache coming from? Maybe the stomach ache is coming from nervousness, which a warming herb is actually going to be a better fit for that. So Ginger Ginger is going to be a better pair for a nervous stomach ache and say peppermint would because peppermint is kind of cooling it makes you feel a little bit more anxious. So so I think really what interests me and what gets me excited about herbal medicine or natural medicine is is Looking at things for face value missing crew wants is trying to tell us what's the bigger picture? Right? Yes, and I think people do what you were just saying with essential oils to I hear a lot of people say when I have a stomach ache I put on digestion blend when I get sick. I put on the on guard blend, but I'm always noticing that we tend to neglect the diet and some of the other factors and think that that's going to be a cure-all and it's really not it's only going to go so far if you're not looking at the big picture. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. And so even with myself even though I know what herb might take a symptom away. I don't always do those things. Like if I rarely get act usually probably get sick maybe once a year but in the fall and the spring I'll have flare-ups of when that whether kind of ping pongs back and forth hot or cold. I'll get you know, runny stuffy nose and kind of just sinus stuff. I don't do anything about The main reason is it doesn't knock me down. It doesn't make me incapable of doing whatever it is that I have to do with my day. And it really if we're looking at what's natural what is nature doing around us. It's ping-ponging back and forth to our bodies go through these transition periods that are totally normal in the fall of the spring where they're activating to the new season the new weather. ER and if we let them do that natural absolutely no activation. We actually write it out better that if we sit and try to you know treat the stuffy nose or treat the runny nose that we might have for just like a week or so as our body reset. Right, that's not going to ultimately be a huge deal. We don't have to rush and treat every glass symptom and the same way. Yeah. I'm the total say way actually I got I think I actually got the flu. I didn't go to the doctor. So I don't know but this season and it really I just let that happen. I drink a lot of water I rested I didn't really even do much with essential oils. I guess I did for my ears because I feel like I had a couple ear infections with it. Other than that, you know because that was sort of painful. I just let it happen and it was done in five days over. Let's talk about a few practical things. Like what kind of herbs do you use on a daily basis? Because we forgot to mention that you have how many children? Right. Yeah, so you probably find yourself. At least I even if you have very healthy kids still dealing with things here and there so what kind of practically how do you use herbs on a regular basis? So tell myself on a daily basis, what I do is I have a regimen so I have a tendency to have dryness overall. So I will have it dry skin. I'll get it done, you know flaky scalp. I am very dry hair and I am cold all the time. So I don't have great circulation. So those tend to be the patterns of things that I deal with with my own health. So just on a daily basis, I take things that support that and just kind of keeping it balanced. I don't necessarily specifically symptom tree, but why hide would every day I'm drinking warming drinks with warming herbs and I boil my body like everyday on my blog. I do have a post on body oiling and that's been one of probably the most beneficial practices for me because when I am adding moisture, I find that A lot of the things I used to have clear up don't flare up. So those are kind of daily things that I do every day. So I drink like chives hyped. He's all day long. I do it till CT which is really nice adapted genetic tea, and it also just it's a warming T. So kind of meets several needs that I have so I drink till see I drink chai I body oil. And I'm get good sleep and I drink a lot of water. I mean those aren't necessarily herbal things, but they're usually the main things I see that I tried first with people before anything else. How much are you sleeping? And how much were you drinking? So those are kind of the daily things I do to support my own body. And then with my kids this is changed recently in the past couple of years how I look at this, but you know, how Ow, what our kids have emotional meltdowns and so you can try to immediately jump in and solve the problems for them or you can like kind of guide them through it and let them find Solutions themselves and I do a lot of that with herbs and with health for them to because really our emotional bodies our spiritual bodies Our physical bodies, they're not that different and so when a kid has a stomach ache or they have a flare up or something. Ask them questions. So I'll say like, where do you feel that? Where do you feel that in your body? Okay, it's your stomach. Is it up here in your upper stomach or do you feel it in your lower stomach, then we'll feel their stomach with them. So like John he was getting stomach aches for a long time and I thought oh, no, he's gonna have food allergies like era, but I'd have it filled his stomach and I could feel the stomach and where the heat was to kind of figure out. Okay. Is this intestinal? Is this higher than you know, the small intestine where it would be more: stuff and it was up higher and intended I ask him. How's this feel? It feels like I'm scared and I realize he's having anxiety stomach aches that it wasn't you know, what they the same as we were staying with are it wasn't constipation wasn't food. It was anxiety. And so I took him. Over and I helped him look at some different things and I kind of you know, I set out the things that I knew would maybe help anxiety more so than others but that I just let him play with them not like what would sound really good to drink or are you know, I love smell or whole oils like essential oils and I'll say what ones are you drawn to like what it what makes you feel really calm and just kind of giving them the power to access. I think when you're a kid and you learn your instincts tends to be right like you have a gut feeling with your That when you kind of give that power away to a doctor or someone else telling you what's going on, you stop trusting that and especially as women we go to a doctor we need to kind of know something's up and they say over your Labs or fine or a we don't show any allergy. We know our bodies pretty well at our kids do to they know their audience pretty well. So I try to let them kind of steer it but then if they will always ask them. Do you want me to give you some ideas, you know for what you could do to Or do you want to just lay here and rest and write it out. We don't have a ton of things pop up. But my oldest she's familiar enough that I think from just watching like my kids have watched me and what I do, but I don't feel good or when I'm helping people and I talk about herbs all the time. So because of that, you know, they kind of know some of it anyway and like Aaron she doesn't even ask me anymore. She'll just go make yourself some tea. You're still going to you know, grab some oils out of my bathroom or whatever it is. She needs but I'm trying to think like on a daily basis what I practically do what the kids that might be helpful, but I think just talking about it and just exposing them to the education that I have an asking lots of questions trying to get just whatever. / what they're saying is they might be saying I to stomachache but what they're really trying to communicate as I'm scared and that's really important. You know, I think to listen and know the difference in your kids when they come to you with something because again, it's symptoms. It's just that way of communication and so with kids it's the same thing and sometimes they don't know sometimes they just know that their stomach hurts. They won't be able to tell you they're scared. But if you ask enough questions, then you know, I'm not giving them. Something that is just to pull the stomach ache. I'm figuring out. Oh, I needed to know that information. I needed to know that they're afraid or that something else is going on. So yeah. Yeah, I guess I don't know if that answers your question really was Harris. No it does do you have this is something I was just thinking about when you were saying this do you have on your blog like a herbs 101 get started with basic things or any influential books that you could recommend on that so people with no, you know where to even begin and never users at all. To I used to I did there still are up and you can find them on YouTube If you searched for herb talks with Jen I used to have like my top 10 herbs. But again, this was while I was going through my first certification and I was really just getting familiar with the plant the chemical constituents the actions that they had at the body. Whereas I feel like now with the second certification. I've been working through I'm learning more about about how to tailor those to the patient and like like where I feel like my first certification was completely on just immersing myself in known plants and their properties. Now when I'm learning is people and their constitution support their ailments or their body organ systems and things like that. So because of that, I'm kind of hesitant to recommend, you know, my previous herbal 101 classes because because I wouldn't Blanket across the board say this is lavender. And here's what it does. However, how you kind of? happy okay, you know and so so the great books something that I would recommend when the anything by like Rosemary glad star Sasha Popham and I'll give you some lists that you can link in the show notes, but even some really basic one of my very favorite books is called Eat Right for your body and it's by Tanja and I can't think of your last name, but it's on like are you betta Keating and what it does is it just kind of goes into what? dudes and implants What they do once they get in your body, so they cool or they warm and it's really basic with food, but it's a great like primer book for knowing how something is going to react when you ingest it. And so that's a great one that I'll send you a list that you can put in your in your notes. Okay. I do occasionally on my blog the way to like if I'm if I'm spotlighting a certainty Blend or something I built. Talk about the different parts and kind of what learned known for or what they do. So so there are some things that they be able to find on my blog. There's all sorts of information on YouTube or on on the internet that you can kind of Google if you're looking for more of a real scientific break down. If you will Google like herbal energy or herbal herbal energy migraine of a bunch of weird hits, but Hey, if you write in Materia Medica herbal, you know, it'll bring up what it does in the body. And so that to me is more interested in it than just knowing like lavender is a natural antihistamine because Lavender is one of those herbs that it will really work. Well for people or it will work terribly. Okay, even something as simple as you know. Injure depending on your body. It's going to be your best friend or it's going to aggravate it take you first. Oh, wow. Okay. Yeah Consulting was really getting into studying plants and then knowing your own this one affected me in this way. It's a good way to know how your body is going to respond. Right. Okay. Yeah, it's definitely not a one-size-fits-all approach. I found that too with just looking at essential oils a little bit. I feel like some people try something and it works really well for them. And like you said, sometimes it goes in the complete opposite but something that I like about talking about herbs. I feel like essential oils are really really popular and pretty much everyone uses them. But herbs are a whenever you use a dried or make a tea for example like you were talking about or like when I was pregnant. Drink lots and lots of red raspberry leaf tea for labor support. Yeah. It's not this insanely concentrated. Sometimes I think we think more is better. And so let's just down the essential oils, but using herbs to support the body is sometimes maybe a more Gentle Way. Well, it's way to you. He's so I use essential oils. I love essential oils, but it's it's steam distilled or cold pressed you're taking an isolate still from a plant which has its uses. It definitely has its place but what's nice about teased or tinctures or decoctions you're using that whole plant and you're either dehydrating it and then rehydrating it or your Using the water soluble Properties or the alcohol soluble properties and the tincture or it took action. And so you're pulling everything out of it. And then I've really been getting lately into it's called. I'm going to pronounce instruments. Like listen to people say it on these modules that I'm taking is part of Jetix. I don't know but it's something that I'm just now starting to get it. It's really interesting because it takes what's left of the plant after you pull out the properties through like a tincture and it burns it down and crystallizes it and uses like the last bit of the plant so you're using and you put that in with your teacher or your tea and so it's like taking the entire plan the whole thing. Cool. Yeah. Yeah, right that that makes sense. You have to think there's a reason why you got it. But yeah, you have to think there's a reason why it came in a whole plant form and you know, not just an isolated part. So do you have any stories like any herbal stories that you want to share knowing that most of your listeners are the most common? Yes, this is something I was going to talk about you because I have I have a story with that as well. Yeah, so that's the most common. I don't either. Dress those two things like Stress and Anxiety and really those are two sides of the same coin often most I would say 95% of people who come to me for hormonal imbalance or Stress and Anxiety. There's something going on in the HPA axis. So yeah, I have lots of neat stories, but It's been really neat and really like gratifying working with women and helping them rebalance their Cycles because typically between one to three Cycles. Owls we've been able to get people back on track which I mean there's all sorts of things as an herbalist that you give people something. You don't know if you're helping them or not. You maybe never hear back or you do here back with that's something that's really rewarding because it is short period of time you're able to see such a big change and and sometimes it's gone for people who are experiencing infertility to being able to get pregnant like within a month or two. This is So that's why I really enjoy working with women on hormone imbalance looking at which part of their cycle. and if they're able to chart and know their Cycles pretty well and know what's a typical cycle for them what their cycle is now, whether the first half of their cycle is border or longer or their second half is shorter or longer single video phase of development that can give us a picture of kind of what's going on with our hormones typically could turn that around really quickly which is which is nice to know cause I know when there are so many women Put up for years with knowing something's off but not knowing what and when they go to their doctor. They're told that their labs are fine. There's no which is so frustrating. I had the same thing happen like three years back. I knew after I had Clementine that my hormones were just want because I'd always been 28 days. Like on the dot and it just changed entirely after I had her and so and I didn't feel good and I went to the doctor first and they said your labs are fine. You know, we don't see anything. That's the matter and so again, I was like, okay. Well then I'm going to figure it out myself at the end, you know, just within a couple months experimenting and things and using herbs to support the different phases of the of my side. I was able to get back on a 28-day regular cycle. So I don't know I don't know that that's like a necessarily a story or narrative. But that's one that I see all the time. I guess just know that's that's huge though because that's a big big problem. And I actually have that so my big herbal story my the things I've use herbs for mostly is pregnancy and fertility and hormonal support because that has been the things that I've just seen the biggest. Mint so for example whenever I was pregnant with one of my children, I had really bad iron deficiency. In fact, I continue to have that pattern but I used herbs to make iron-rich tinctures. And then after my second child my hormones were crazy. Like I was having weeks long Cycles like 30 straight days and three different times. I took Vitex for three months and then not only did I right. But then I ended up pregnant within three months every single time. I did that. So mine is similar. I used by text to bring my hormones Back in Balance and saw amazing results from that the chasteberry. Yes, absolutely. Those are 20 days almost exactly like a menstrual cycle and when you are supporting your body do a line with nature, so like circadian rhythms. We know if we sleep according the circadian rhythms are bodies just they're naturally more healthy when we you know, go to bed with the sun and wait with the sun and it's the same thing for women with lunar cycles interesting. If you spend a lot of time in danger your Cycles will naturally aligned. Really fascinating when I started studying it and if you're if you're always in doors and you're never out in nature a lot of times your Cycles will get crazy is you know, and they don't line up but when you're really my whole like hey, I go outside and I walk at night when I'm watering. My plants are almost always with the full moon and start menstrual cycle the new baby like it's just like start To see the patterns and I just when I look at that, I just think oh my gosh got spacing because yeah you see in nature is really reflected inside. It's incredible. Yeah. It's just exciting to me anymore. It's an area that I love. I can't imagine ever not being learning new things about herbs or health or yeah, it's your passion. I one of the things I read about whenever I was having those issues with usually postpartum. I would have extremely weird Cycles, which I know for postpartum is normal, but they didn't seem to ever want to come back in the balance without Vitex and something that I About was we were living in a house as you know, right next to a park and there were Park lights literally shining in our bedroom master bedroom window. I mean right outside of it. We're talking 50 feet and I've always wondered if that was causing it because all night long. Our room was like you could walk around without a light because it was so bright all the time, which I should have just got some room darkening Shades instead of worrying about this, but instead I let my Cycles go crazy and I wonder if that caused it. Yeah, that's up to do with it. Well, it's interesting because there are practitioners that I read studies about who when their truck working with women on regulating their Cycles. They will just have them open their windows at night and be like, this is called Blue mating in see I couldn't do that though because I had this artificial parklife exactly. Yeah. So that makes sense though in our new place. We we moved in and they had a dust it on light right outside of the master bedroom. And I was like unplug that thing like why no, we moved to the country no more light, but I definitely Everything is going around you and understanding that when we're in a natural world. Our bodies are going to function more. Naturally. I think it sounds simple but yeah, it sounds simple but it's but in today's world. It's actually very difficult to do it has to be intentional used to be an obvious part of life. But now it has to be an intentional thing right well enough. I'm drawn to it because it's using nature, you know in whatever I'm doing it and it's not that like you here in this common. It kind of makes me cringe a little when I hear people say. Oh, yeah. I used to have some remedies. I don't use chemicals and I want to say like the first thing I studied when I studied herbs is like the chemical constituents because I hurt yeah, that's too broad of a turn chemicals and What they mean by that what they mean by the using something more natural and not chemicals is something that like it just feels intuitive. Like it's what is in your backyard. You have a connection to it. You're amongst it all day. You know, I think I can grow herbs and give them to people but I recommend obviously that they grow their own because what you're working in in your own soil and what you have your own, you know connection to asking to be what's going to work best for you. Honestly the you can buy stuff and it can work. There's no doubt about that. But whatever you have a personal connection to I think will always be my Top Choice when you're getting out there in in the soil cultivating it and that's going to all be part of the picture so that X license. I've never thought about all of that and I do want to really quit go back to work you were talking about how Vitex doesn't work for everyone and I did I forgot to mention that because I remember whenever I was researching It I read that, you know, this could go two ways. They could either mess you up worse or it could work for you. So for me and my body type it works. I don't want to recommend anybody just start taking it because yeah, it could be the opposite effect. Yeah. What you said whenever I was having this issue and I figured out that the second half of my cycle was short and so I knew it was a progesterone deficiency. So I don't want just anybody to think that I just Into the start taking biotech, I did advocate for myself and figure out, you know, if it would be a beneficial thing. Yeah, so that's something to make sure you know, because you don't just jump into it and it just work for like you said, it's very individual. It's it's very it's something you need, you know at this is your first time you've never read into this because I've been pretty into this stuff for a while to and so I kind of knew how to Diagnose my cycle and know where the issues were. But if it is a where do you recommend people finding someone like you in their local area? Yeah, well, I'm sure a lot of times chiropractors will have connections or know of someone if you're wanting to see someone locally. You can try addio doctors they tend to be more open to natural alternative alternative medicine. So they may have some resources certainly if you don't even have to your paths, I do online consultations. No, no, okay. So you do take online clients, okay. There's a one-hour initial consultation. And from there. I can do follow-ups that are just 30 minutes which are you know, after I know like the background of the person and so I did this online and you can find lots of herbalist online that will do the same type of thing. So if you don't have someone local you can usually find someone Yeah, because sometimes you know, this is your first experience into using that kind of thing. It makes sense to get some guidance, especially when you're talking about something like cycles and If somebody is trying to address a particular issue, you know, you don't you don't want to undo any progress or take something like that. If you're doing IVF or you know, that would not be something good. Yeah. It's so important to know if someone is taking other medicines what they've tried in the past what tends to make you feel better what tends to make things worse before you start playing because you know at its root yes herbs can be more mild than medicine and Are certainly more natural always my first go-to, but they do have side effects like anything else and so it's important to know what you're doing or doing research. Okay, so I'm going to be leaving down in the show notes links from your blog and some of the things that you mentioned some of the books that you mentioned your herbal consultations. Tell us again where we can find you. I know you already mentioned it but let's just start that up again. Instagram I met the underscore Wildflower assist and then on Facebook as The Wildflower East and then I also have my website the wild florist. Okay. Okay. Good. Damn it going to cost also will thank you so much. Thank you so much. I feel like we had a really good discussion on herbs. Nothing. It's kind of a This is something for you to start learning and exploring not this is what you should take right now, which is not really the direction I expected to go but I also definitely should have expected to go away because that's how it is. This is not I'm used to take this for this symptom and that is Often I imagine understand the desire for that because it would be so easy, right? You know, like I just but unfortunately that usually ends up serving like a bigger issue down the line, you know, whereas if you're supporting your overall health and just constantly investing in your own life Baseline Health. A lot of those things are going to resolve. Yes. Yes that makes so much sense. Well, if you enjoyed this episode make sure to join me in the next one episode 23 of the simple farmhouse. live podcast
