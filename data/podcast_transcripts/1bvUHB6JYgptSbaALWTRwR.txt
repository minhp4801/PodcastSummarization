Like I'm excited to be here. Very excited. Real excited to meet you and talk to you is the first time I'm actually meeting right? We always we always actually chill on Instagram and on text and WhatsApp and stuff that yes. Yes, like first time we're meeting physically because you don't come for my gigs. You should come for my gigs mode of Iago I try to come out for gigs, but sometimes I just like to sit in the house and sleep early on the side good. Yeah good scenes. So tell me about your journey. How did you start off here? Okay, so I basically Basically started when I was in school. Okay, it was 9th 8th standard. I started in the loop HD scenes you can say okay. I have to make collections on my computer and write CDs and distribute them to the local DJ's and the sound guys, you know, you guys were playing in the streets for completely agree. Are you serious? Yeah, so that's how I got into the scene and That time I should do it as a hobby not as a full-time thing. I didn't grow up with these kind of friends with these guys. You can lower the surrounding or how do you come across and made these people I met these people Neo my you know, since cool. Okay, there was a friend who was connected to this V pill and I got a chance to actually go and sit in the go down by the keep all the sounds and all. Oh my gosh doubt the amplifiers and sound the so that time. I'm it was a big deal for me like to go just spend time in the Go download The Play music on the week big speaker. Okay, that's like a big thing to do actually see ya. You know, there's no volume control. Nothing nothing. Okay, so it's good to hang out over there. Great. Yeah. So how did you get into I mean for your transition from from that kind of and see how did you come to where you are right now you're doing primarily house and techno. How did this happen Okay, so I was in school. I started the scene over there. And later on I complete my college and I was working as well. Okay, well be working. I was working in many different companies for example walking Venture ocalan yoga. Okay, but how it was on and off like I was not walking the continuously extra work for six seven months change my job because I was in college bro. Like, you know, I had to have fun too. So great. And after that it was until I got in an accident. Okay, and but after the accident I was in bed for like bedridden for two to three years, I guess for three years. Okay, and three years. I didn't really have anything to do with I was just in bed and that's how I cannot give a thought why should you know start learning production? Okay, because I was into music. I wish to listen to all kinds of music from my college days my school days commercial hip hop music. We listen to some other Burn my college days. There was more I was more into a pop. Okay dubstep. Then there came a time where I was in to house music again, David Guetta came into the scene Afrojack. So how did you who introduced with these guys it was with my friends internet? Okay, and that what that time we had Channel V. Yeah, so MTV and VH1 as well. I think VH1 came on later bud. The hip-hop scene was more popular on MTV, I guess so your source of information was friends and even television. Yeah, and I got into production I was into bed and I thought I should give it a try and I really wanted to get myself on beatport cause I was really fascinated about, you know, getting a release done and it's very exciting the first beep or releases. Very exciting right? You have to tell everyone no matter how shitty the tracking it's always everyone's yeah. I mean you can go The release it's a different feeling like, you know, you make your own music and it's finally up there for everyone to listen to so, let's go. Let's go bit back. How do we learn? So production was at home everything you wanted no production. I started learning when I was in the hospital in the hospital. Are you serious? Yeah Cuban stuff. Yeah YouTube I had my headphones. Okay, and what do I learn production-wise was on headphones? And I at the start I didn't really have monitor headphones. I was just using normal phone. Headphones. All right and FL Studio and started basically, I started learning to make hip hop beats. Okay, because that's I feel you know, the base base even for I will shoot you if you are not know how the software works of course and it's hip-hop then I got then I started getting more into vsts and plugins, you know, there was a time when I used to like when I'm hitting my first tack it was The Sago he popped three two and a half minutes, I guess. Okay, and it was a shitty track, but I really liked it because you know, I sat there for like a whole day and you know, I made something out of it and exported it somehow and I was listening to it on my phone and you know, it was a happy moment for me and that's how it all started and that's how I kept doing it cause I didn't really have a lot of time in the hospital. Okay. I mean I had my Physiotherapy and all but I was free in the Afternoon, and the evening is mostly older. So I really like to you know set there and give myself time with music and learn production. There was YouTube and internet helping me around. Okay, and that's how I got into scene. So the entire time you just want YouTube and that's how you figure out the entire thing. And and how did you come into so so like you said you started into hip-hop the how why did you make a decision that you know, probably produce only house and techno. So basically when I started I wanted to make Progressive out of okay, but to achieve those sounds it was when you're when you opening FL shooter for the first few times. You don't really have any idea how to of course. So it was really difficult to figure out how these guys are making their sounds and even for example that kicks. It's a task that time with you guys. So I thought why not, you know start from something like and I got into it. A pop I made a profile on Soundcloud profile on YouTube. Okay, I made around 1012 beats. So when was your first track that came across like from the time? He started Lego here is switched on officially for the first time and what is the time duration where you made your first I'm not saying in terms of good quality by in terms of an entire workflow in entire structure with a proper intro made, you know hip-hop. I was FL Studio. I didn't really have I was not confident enough to You know that my track is full of images making hip hop beats. It was 300 350 3.5 years to work on how many how much minutes is done on the track. I don't know like I have to basically concentrate more on the main hook. Okay. So if that's good like the hook the way, you know the house there was they say that the rapper good, you know introduces. So that's that's what I consider, but that's it. Means in was I just wanted to get it out and you know get a review from people. So I started uploading out on Soundcloud. Okay, and YouTube is and later on as it got pretty big like two years time. I guess started this in 2012-2013. Okay, and in one one and a half your home FL Studio, I shifted to Ableton. Why was that switch? Why was it necessary because if actually is pretty pretty Compact and for especially for beginners it kind of helps. And see a pile this is what I think. I don't know like what are those thing? But I feel there is more you can do on F a built-in then FL Studio because you know the name like a built-in it's live. You can do life shit on it a land FL Studio all programmed program. Yeah means you can't use you can use but you know, I don't really feel comfortable. I feel my sounds is more better on a building. Okay, and I have a more control over a building. Then FL and I'm I feel more comfortable actually producing on because that time F will was good. But I wanted to you know, try something different. Okay, and also improve my sound sound quality and that time after you pop I started producing Psy trance music. Okay. I still have a EP release date till date of three tracks, which got uploaded on a very nice Channel on YouTube. Let's go music. Okay, so they uploaded my bodied was independently set was not like on a label or anything. All right, and then I took time like I took a break for I guess two and a half three years after that two years. I guess that's in in production and production. Yes. Why why is that was learning I wanted to do my thing. I was I wanted to get into house and techno. So so you said you you stop production. I mean you stop letting the music go out. Yeah, I didn't lose anything. I was just working working on music. Yeah, cuz you know I did he Pop I did but I really wanted to get into house and techno was that's why I started production. Basically, what's your first experience of a house track or where is the first time you've experienced a club with his house music playing or any DJ in that particular order was playing the first time my attack was I was really inspired by Deadmau5 music. Okay, and you know the groove just the normal Groove is no nothing like it's cake and snare. That's I was really moved with that, you know Groove just for to the flow cake and goings. He just going on to the whole track, but it's so groovy and you know makes you move. So I was really interested in to that music. Okay, and the First Act I listened to was not in a clogged pores on my headphones only. I was listening the the that time they used to make a show on Radio Mirchi at night one hour. EDM show. Okay. I'm not a murderer, but that's great have if they did that that yeah that and used to play 1 hour only on Saturdays, I guess. Okay, so they have to play one that time. I used to get to know all the new tracks and all was going on and also we had internet. So yeah, so your first release tell me about your first laser actually went out. How did that happen? How did you get a label? I started making tax house and techno. I didn't really have any idea on which label I'm gonna release and think I just wanted to get my If on beatport, and and I was really fascinated about beatport and all you know, why is that so but and I'd like, you know, if you if you see from artists perspective, like if you if you like, you know, if you open beatport didn't may be normal for some people but it's like a different story for people like me, you know, you feel fascinated like seeing this guy is playing their own music making their own music and it really got my attention. Like now I want to do this like I want to be the The so that's how I that what got me started. I thought that still I wanna be there on the top hundred maybe one day of course. So yeah your first thing your first release of actually happen. How did that work out? I released around six or seven tracks on Soundcloud. Okay. They were just laying down like I didn't send it to any labels. I know but somehow I got in contact with this label got trippy good. All right, and so hungry things. Let it be so hungry. Yeah, they like my few track. I said if they like my few tracks white not I sent them all my tracks. So I sent them all my tracks and they ended up selecting it them old but they released it on one click three-piece. Okay, one on their major label as trip record two EPS on the sub-label Time techno. Okay, so that was my first release in 2019. Okay, three p's with I guess seven tags. Great. So what what next time when we'll how do they go across because I think the last year you've got around 20 plus releases yarn Intel data made around 37 tax on 12. You see her teen yeah like tomorrow up to tracks are coming out. Are you serious? How is this frequency so much. I mean how much time do you take to make a track? Basically? I don't really have anything to do much like I'm just sitting at home. Okay, making music or either listening to music and even if I go out I don't So much time like Max six five hours. So when I'm home, I'm not doing anything. I'm just sitting on my laptop and making music. So that's what you know, I think it's a plus point for me. Tell us about your DJing a how's it going with the DJing DJing is going good getting to play in the city. I'm doing a few gigs this month. Wow, trying to get like, you know, whatever's coming on my way. I'm just going to do you approach the club's they approach would you have someone agent some agency was how does it work not? Really like people who approach me also my friends. Okay. I also sometimes go and approach if anyone you know eyes go and send my profile to everyone. Okay, the promoters agencies and also sometimes I go at the venue and talk to the people great. Yeah, so it helps like, you know, whatever it is, you know, whatever you think is going to help you I try to do it, but you know, I can like go every way So yeah, I'm trying my best. What do you enjoy more? I enjoy more production then DJing. Okay, cause you know when production you don't have anything like, you know, there's a lot of time you can give your own Groove and owned by to your tax. Okay, you don't have to like, you know, think about anything when you're playing you're DJing you have to think about Awards or you have to play next is a you know, crowd enjoying your music. Does this song will go after? For this song You Know many things come to your mind just goes you're facing the life would eventually of course production is different you sitting in front of your screen. You have other things going on in your mind. Like, you know, what kind of proof do you want to have or maybe just go with the flow sometimes, you know, I just sitting production run. I want to just go with the flow and at the end of the day see if the tax going good if you like that Arc know, but how was your how is your workflow? Like like you said like 34 tracks you said in the last couple of years? Is what how do you like sit down? You sit on a blank piece of paper and start working on it or how does it work? Do you have some reference point? We have something that we thought about and then you want to kind of do it or how does it work for you? See basically when I sit down it's nothing in my mind just an empty blank a built-in new set. What I do is I start either with a Groove that may be a dumb groove or maybe a groove on a synth or just a, you know normal audio clip which has Something which I like so long process I can say like if you start making you can make a Groove in like 2 hours 3 hours. That's not a problem. But the main thing is to properly complete your track post production pre-production staff. Okay, then there Comes The Sound selection lot of time goes inside. So what I do basically is if I'm approaching some label if I have some label in my mind, I'll try and set and listen to their music properly. Okay, like, you know, legally constituted in like one what minute what what effects they are you Okay. What onboard minute the breakage starting what minute they again introducing the second drop? Okay, you know what lead they're using in the second drop what defects and other things so like for example, just like previous month. I have wanted to get signed to a label called after Tech. Okay, so I did send them a track and even got selected but the scene was that my track was melodic enough, but they thought that It was good enough, but they wanted to make a few changes out of it's okay. So the scene was as I told you I when I start I don't really have anything in my mind, you know, sometimes you also have to go according to the label. You know, what the label wants because you can just keep making what you like. Of course, if you eventually not everyone's gonna like what you like sometimes, you know, you have to see other people reflexive. What you do is you study the record label for everything of your label eventual. Have their own Vibe I can say and eventually they are the best judges to judge your tracks. So you try your best what what I feel is high time. I bashed in production I from start on the cake or maybe whatever it is, but I concentrate more on the midsection. You can see the drop. Okay, the main Groove that's what I concentrate more on my production and it is really fun. Like it's a long process but it's fun. What's your dream record label right now? What are you looking? For towards going to be that song that song other like label that you have there. Okay, you know I've done this now, I think let me focus on something else at the same time for now. My dream record label would be untrue not deep and there's one more record label this record label called Dynamic and goes of course. Yeah, so sometimes they will yeah, but it's really hard to get on this line as and so I understand have you sent some traction though. Yes. I've been sending to anjuna deep like S&M rice. Okay, they got eject now, what is good? Like, you know you get experience for you know, how to improve like, you know, I keep sending time till I one day I will I'm pretty sure you'll go to with the day is not farm and I'm pretty sure we're going to kill it in in that sense. Yes. I did and I'm really looking forward also to release on a few new record labels which are new but they Not have much falling but these are called labels are like supported from Big artists like who releases on big labels? Okay, so I'm actually now I'm open to all the record labels that I would but I have one day really want to get mad attack on the top and this is his will definitely go there. So tell me one thing I could do other than your family. Are they supporting your scene or the okay with you because see although you're producing music and producing good music. We are definitely working on a rage on which is very difficult you different it's not Something that everyone could probably understand and since the back of that you've come from and it's a completely bipolar is a very different thing from probably doing something commercial and on the road and to doing like an underground techno or house house record is your family supporting it. Yeah. My family is like you just made my mom and dad. Okay, and so no siblings no siblings and alone, sir. Yeah, so they support me in all the ways they can like however, they can and for the music scene also, they do support me but You know eventually you have to do something on your own like you can't depend on them, but they know that this is your eventual plan that you want to become a producer energy as they know they know everything what I'm doing where I am performing what I'm doing, but eventually like, you know, they also trying to get a job for me. Okay, like this drug is happening here like on and off, you know family issues still go on and the Sandman and I to refuse so your focus in your clear the hundred percent. You want to stick to the music India at least for the more five six. Them will not stick to it. That's your time. You're giving yourself about five six years. Yeah to make sure that you're there. Yeah, how many gigs you do in a month? How often do you play I try to do at least two gigs a month? Okay and either I approach whatever like if they approach me but I like to do more like if I get a chance, I like to play every weekend great. Everyone wants to do that. Of course. Okay, so a couple of tricks that you want to share something that you use in your process in terms of production. That you want to tell the audience that you do which is you know, which we know that this is probably Nicole see is sound see are basically try to use all the stock plugins like vsts. And my sound basically is more like I use Simple beads, but I like to use a lot of melodic stuff like this since the leads even the effects sometimes, you know, there are few tracks of mine. I've even used vocal samples. Okay, I like to use vocal samples. So yeah you can Find my sound like you know simple beats with rhythmically. It's all right, and what's the future plan of what? What are the records you working on right now? Anything is in the process right now. I'm actually working on a few tracks. I'm collaborating with a few artists from Pune outside Pune. Okay. Let's see how it goes some for five projects going on right now. So that's that's the plan for 2020 or 504 plan guarantee. I have other plans. I want to get into a building. I want to get certified from Um Logano sit for the exam able to wow, so I'm maybe I'll start preparing for that this year. Okay, so maybe hopefully I got to set for this year. If not the next year. All right, is anything that you feel has has made you stronger anything that you want to share? Yeah, I mean at the start when I wanted to get in the local level down to production, but I was not into the locals in March. Okay. Okay scene is in the sense. You didn't know any Penny, but I didn't come out in the clubs again. I didn't really have any. How to get a gig so that time I contacted a few artists from Pune OK and they are more than happy to help me and I really appreciate them helping me out actually to tell you the there was the first gig after my accident was you're eska and it was secretly seeing over there. Wow, and I got in contact with him and it was my fault like you can say after my accident was my first check I have and for and I really had a good time listening to him. So there's the first time we went after your actually actually I think in 2012. Yeah. So are you in touch with him? I have you. Yeah, we are in touch but not that much but I you know if I need any help or anything really is a great fellow if you can release it and I got a chance to meet like these people. He is a secret even squish take is I got to meet Nicholson up. I got to meet diatonic. Wow, even you are meeting today. Come on. So, you know, I started the same ranks is there but I'll take the Ruined but still, you know, you get to learn so many things from because sequel when I met him he was very nice enough even introduced me to a few local guys, you know, umm car tapasya. Okay, so try yeah, so these are so these guys also I'm working. I'm working on attack with the Persian music right now greater and yeah, so these people help me out help me in my early stage. I even spoke to him on the call. He was very helpful. Awful, like you told me what to do. And who's your who's your go-to person when you make a record who's your go-to person? And who's the person tells you on your face? Keep Roebuck Was Gonna Wanna everybody should have that one person who says, you know what this is not great. Do you have anyone like that whose they're not really workers? I think you know, you are the best person though, you know, Joe song like if you're not sure about what I do is if I'm not sure about attract. I just keep it laying on my laptop for a month or something and after a month with of You know fresh yours with was a great that's a great idea and then you listen to the track and then you know, you get a drink and even if you're not sure then you have your friends. Of course, you can send it. But first you make sure your track is good enough then you send it to other people. Yeah. All right, man. So what's the plan was the next step was the next big thing that's happening for you in your music career my music career. I'm actually planning to go to Goa this month. Great. See I'm trying to To get into seen over there. Let's see how it goes great stuff here and for 2012 as I said, I might sit for the exam. So I will die. I want to get certified. So let's see how it goes. And also I'm working on a few releases. Okay and behind few labels like I want to get my tracks on those labels. So let's see how it goes. All right any tips and tricks that you want to share with the new producers? A lot of people are picking up the Underground Music Scene right now any tips because Most of us are self learned. So any tips that you want to give them mean. Yeah, I let you know just go for it. Like what are you wanna achieve it? Like it's like maybe you're not make a track, you know, some people like their into production, but you know, I've got a few people, you know coming up to me and telling me up I'm into production all but they get stuck, you know, when they making a track like, you know, they get shocked. I like just complete it somehow like complete the address is completed somehow if it's go to bed make it into a Avi file and keep it don't don't worry about the production and quality just completed and you know see about it listen to it 10 times, you know, maybe a hundred times if you want. Okay, and you know compare your track to other people and you know, just just go for it. Whatever you want is, you know, sometimes people get lazy and I don't know so we have to learn that and don't do that like just go and do not constitute more on learning the basics. I feel like the vhd is and all like Don't need to download any vht every week or anything. You have your basic vhd is you can do a lot with what you have. You have like a proper Studio setup right now at home or how was your boss your workstation? Yeah. I have my laptop my monitor speakers. Okay. I have a keyboard. Okay, and I have my controller great.
