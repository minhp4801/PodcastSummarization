Welcome to pop and policies with your hosts are Jordan Davis. Thank you so much for tuning in. You could have chosen another podcast to listen to you taking the time to listen to me. And so I am grateful and I do not take the opportunity lightly. This podcast is actually airing a year to the day after a really bad car accident that left my car totaled. I was in a hard place of selfishness and self-reliance, but it really took that moment to Humble me and for me to take a few steps back and really realize what are the gifts that God has given me what has God given me to impact to make an impact and I instantly began to write. Okay connectivity. Okay this passion for politics this desire to Enlighten and educate people about maybe the long-term or direct impacts that policy issues may have and I wanted something to bridge all of those gifts together in a podcast is what came to mind popping policies the name of the podcast actually came to me in a dream. And so I am grateful to be on this journey this podcast will focus on policy issues and topics within the political sphere that affect the black community. I hope that you will join us on this journey different guests will come into the Situation Room. Yes. I have dubbed it the situation room after the Room in the White House where top Officials monitor talk about and deal with crisis and so in that same way here on pop and policies. We will monitor talk about in deal with crisis that affect the black community and so with the welcome being established your family now and I cannot wait for you to listen to the first episode of popping policies with our Jordan Davis.
