Welcome to the stoic meditations podcast where each time we consider a bit of wisdom from the ancient philosophies of Greece and Rome. I am Massimo pigliucci a professor of philosophy at the City College of New York, and I will guide you through this readingin season 4 episode 558 reflect on Cicero de finibus 331 The chief got consists in applying to the conduct of life and knowledge of the working of natural causes choosing what is in accordance with nature and rejecting what is contrary to it? In other words the chief God is the living agreement and in harmony with nature. We've encountered the stoic notion that we should live in accordance with nature before that's because it's a crucial one. It has been presented throughout the Arc of ancient story system from Zeno of sight him to Marcus Aurelius. The first thing to get clear about is that this isn't an appeal to nature, which is a logical fallacy. The stoics are not saying that whatever is natural is good. What they are saying is that to ask what a good human life consists of without taking into account the nature of the species Homo sapiens is unproductive stoicism is a naturalistic philosophy. So it's ethics is derived from its understanding of the world not blacked out of thin air and since for the stoics the two crucial characteristics of human beings are that we are highly social and capable of reason it follows for them that are fulfilling human life is one in which we apply reason to the Improvement of social living. Imagine what the world would be like if more people took this simple precept to Heart. Thank you for joining me for another stoic meditation.
