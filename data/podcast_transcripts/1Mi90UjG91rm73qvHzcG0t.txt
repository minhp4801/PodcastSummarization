Hi everyone. Welcome to ocbc insights. I'm Selena Ling Chief Economist for CPC bang today. I'm sharing with you about the feds emergency 50 basis point cut the fat unanimously cut the federal funds rate by an emergency 50-point citing a material change in the u.s. Outlook due to the covid-19 outbreak fed chairman Powell basically indicated that the virus and the measures that are being taken to contain. It will surely way on economic activity both in the US and abroad for some time. This came earlier than scheduled March fomc meeting but clearly illustrates. What we said about the FED being cornered in to a 50 basis point cut by market. The question that remains is where will the FED go from here? If you reference the G7 meeting of Finance Chiefs that actually felt to reveal more than verbal jawboning. So our senses look to the market reaction Wall Street quickly sold off while US Treasury bonds got an adrenaline boost. We saw the two-year you basically following 20.7 percent in the US and the 10-year treasury. You also dipping his toes to the 1% handle. VIXX is still hovering around an elevated level of 36 handle. Market is not anticipating another 50 basis point cut by June so we would see fat rhetoric in the coming days and weeks to take a greater prominence on whether they can deliver again. My sense is to watch the demand side of things because the feds over reaction does suggest something a little bit more Sinister at work than purely a virus outbreak in some supply chain disruptions. In the near term Asian markets may be in for choppy session. The flight to safety will likely learn a supportive bit to Asian Bond markets as they re calibrate to the feds move, but we do need to be selective look for those countries with less limited policy room to outperform.
