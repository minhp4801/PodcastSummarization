Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something. What you know, you can't explain. But you feel it. You felt it your entire life. That there's something wrong with this world. You don't know what it is, but it's there. Like a splinter in your mind. Driving you crazy. It's this feeling. This is why you're here. Do you know what I'm talking about? Do you want to know what it is? The system is everywhere. It's all around you. You can see it when you go to work. Look out your window. Or put on the news you can feel it when you pay your taxes. When you kiss your wife, goodnight. and when you listen to the high priests it is a world that has been pulled over your eyes to Blind you from the truth. the truth that you are a slave. born into bondage born into a prison you can't taste smell or touch. a prison for your mind You can't be told what the system is. You have to see it for yourself in action.
