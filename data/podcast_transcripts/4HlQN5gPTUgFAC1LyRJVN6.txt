The wise men say preview show looking ahead to the Jillian game. Unfortunately, Martin Rory the idiot podcast isn't here this evening. So we don't really have a thing we can actually go through but we do have is people with jarring accents. They'll think hey, why do they support Sunderland? I'm your host Tom Walsh and I'm here with Jim. Hello and Matt. Hello Joe once again as cried off because this time he's got a nasty dark but of Coronavirus.We wish him. All the best in is we what we just hope he doesn't die. So I'll be good. Anyway Gillian gam joining us this Saturday, but us kick off with an announcement yesterday that son until I die to is coming. And obviously it's out on April Fool's Day, which they say they're not doing this on purpose, but it feels like some reason every step along this way is done with let's all laugh at Sunderland. Are we excited about this not especially for me? I mean as much as you know, it's quite it's quite good in the way to be able to watch to watch the behind-the-scenes Clips. Most of my time spent not living in the Northeast consists of me having to tell people I'm someone plan the first thing they always say to me now is our view seems too long till I die - why? Yes, it was horrible to live through it the first time never mind washing it again. So let's have another series of an even more depressing season giving what happened at the end is not filling me with joy, but at the same time it might be quite funny. So well, that's the thing a lot of other teams seem to get very excited about it Portsmouth, especially and Charlton. Well, they were there Twitter banths spell checkatrade by the way. Just shout out the Portsmouth Twitter. Admin who can't spell check a treat. I don't know if that was Brett Pittman behind the tweets there or another similarly in Similar idiot, but well done. Well, they'll be able to spell it leasing.com like better but they the last the last series even though it was the worst like the document of the worst his season in our history. It did provide some funny moments. I mean like, you know, Chris Coleman saying he's got six kids and that was a wet. But like what are we the saying it's going to be very Donald and mething heavy which is made of that what you will so what? Would you like to see Matthew from it? I'm quite looking forward to it. I wouldn't quite say I'm excited but like you say the first year was really fascinating compelling stuff just to see what was going on behind the scenes. Obviously, we knew what was happening on the pitch, but getting that extra Insight was interesting. I thought and as someone who also doesn't live in the Northeast when I talk to people about it. They're generally quite sympathetic the words. I don't know but that the certainly Not kind of laughs and a pity you really laughing at us about it. I wouldn't say the people. I've met there that the the find it quite a squat and interest in children far more far more interesting than things like the the Man City documentary. For example, I'm particularly interested to see the bit where Richard Hill serves the club and I'll be I think that'll be an episode It's Only Imagine. Yeah, I think that'll be interesting and I think I would probably dread a little bit more if the current owners weren't after. Looking to sell the club. Yeah. Well, we'll get into that later because once again, there's more news that we're going to be sold in Aunt Leigh. I just it will be quite interesting to see how it's just the beginning of it how if it focuses on Jack Ross Melanson to turn this ragtag bunch of losers that he picked up on day 1 into this something that was you know, who's we thought we were going to get promoted and for all you said it was a disappointing season for long periods of it is thought it was exciting wasn't it? I mean it was and I think like people sort of I've seen, you know be reverted Donald in method and sort of like, yeah you Del Boy and Rodney Trotter I think is probably more going to be David Brent and Gareth Keenan, but I think at the same time it might be quite funny and part of mean Jack Ross they do an incredible job to get that ragtag bunch of Misfits into it into a reasonable times League one side. Books at the same time. I think it's going to be hard viewing. I'm excited for the transfer deadline Day episode if that does make it to it. And I think also the player final viewing will be the talk of football banter Twitter quite some time. I just I didn't like that whole I didn't like it on the day. I didn't I don't want to relive it. I've never watched that game back. There is no point of that day, which is actually good. I mean like even going to Wembley with boring because we went a couple months earlier and it was much better. So yeah, I think I might just leave off the episode rather than having weird child and fans crowing about it. It's all I mean if we end up going up this season and it will be fine really wanted but if we miss out again, then it is going to be like a clan of horrifying recurring dream that we're just sort of reliving all over and over and over again. Well, it sounds like something's we do is sudden and fans every season is filled with that. Disappointment and on that note, we're not dealing them on Saturday. And he said it's one of these games where on paper you think we should smash these but under Steve Evans Steve Evans with your face like an angry Plum, but he's actually quite the really quite good. It's like under the radar. They've worn big not lost. We lost one game in 16 in the league which by any stretch of the well, it's very instructive. Any imagine any imagination that's really good and they're going to prove a test. Yeah. I mean it's this is going to be the fourth time this season. We played them each game was more depressing than the previous one culminating in that famous late. Well, it was at the league game The Last bullet the third time we played them. Yeah. Yeah, we're you know as it was reference on Mondays pods. Everyone was baffled as to help archicad. Job after that but we did and we picked up since then. I'd like to think the sooner and pendulum on Saturday is a totally different outfit to that. They played so far like you say they're decent they've got a good run but fundamentally, it is a little bit of a cliche but it all seems as if we are serious about going up. We need to be winning this game. Of course, I mean as I checking their fixtures before the go in this run when they played big teams, especially away from home. They've gone there and both in Ipswich and it pita bread. They've got nil-nil drawers. So are we going to expect there are come up back against the wall kind of thing and just force traitors thing is that the the R&D some form of they were but I think they lost the weekend and they're like, yeah AFC Wimbledon at home to Wimbledon. You aren't one of the strongest teams in the league. I wouldn't say but there are waveform particular is really strong. They haven't they haven't lost an away game since its 23rd of November and against that that again that was against So maybe a bit of a bogey team for them or they just got them kind of figured out but I think they'll be I think they'll be a tough team to break down. But I think we'll have enough I think we'll have enough to beat them because I think man for man, we're good enough to me to meet you as well will be plenty of games and ship on show we played Steve Evans Peter breath last season at the stadium light, which was their famous for Brian. Ahve a dual booting. Going was it Madison or Tony the backside for no apparent reason and Steve Evans going going mental on such long as he always does I mean, you know to be fair to the guy you might not be everyone's cup of tea, but there's a reason why he keeps getting jobs at this level. He knows how to set up a team to wind up the opposition getting their faces play hard and that's what that's what happened. So there's no way we're going to be able to turn up and expect to roll them over but at the same time if you look at their ability level, At least on paper like that was saying but also even just looking at recent results. We really tall intensive purposes have to be an arrogant. It may sound blistered if we're serious of especially after the past two results we've had I mean you say in about a shit how Zuri we saw that with Fleetwood last Tuesday, and it's not the case of we didn't cope with it, but it's it's hard it's hard when a team It comes to the state that we saw at Lowe's last season with like Wickham Wicked for prime example the time-weighted from the first minute and that's why I feel we really really need to get back to that kind of High Press football from the off that we saw against Rochdale and tunics. So Rochdale Wickham Lincoln games, and that's the way so we're gonna goal. They're going to are you like to think they're gonna crumble it's folks find a way to win is not The end of the day and like for us in the way we play the best way to get to stop that shit house during that that delaying tactic Nora is that like you say getting their face and score early? So for us to be pragmatic about the game would be to do that as opposed to try and match them, you know in the shit house during the long board times we have to get in the face has hit the ball on the floor and help them. Of course the problem the last two games and what prevented us from doing that as we've conceded really early in both of them. So that that's completely affected our game plan. And and fair enough of we were playing much stronger opposition. But if we're going to have we're gonna have we're gonna get off to such a bad start particularly. If we then let the opposition get a goal ahead. Then we're going to be chasing the whole game. I mean even Coventry considering how they're in a really strong position in the league. There are good side, but they are quite happy for us to have 60 70 percent possession after they've gone in front. So we really need to start the game in a much better way than we have them. I don't know whether that's donor fatigue and not refreshing the team a little bit. Who knows but we need to make sure that we don't do the same thing on Saturday, but that's why it's got to come onto again. We're at the last weekend. Sorry last week was three games in a week and we're starting again another starting again with like so we've got killing him on Saturday way to Bristol Rovers and I way to Blackpool and my friend my friend pointed out the other day that when we've gone on these sets of of fixtures and Parkinson's played the same team as he has been doing we always lose the third game and it's it's if that's the case we can't afford or needs really needs to freshen this team up because I thought at Coventry, I mean it was a terrible pitch as well, but the lads look dead on the feet after about 60 minutes. Yeah. I mean the Coventry game for that read the Portsmouth game. The last time we had a run of games, especially so with arguably the toughest of the three as ports. wasn't as Coventry was as the last of the three and together for a degree that Blackpool this time will be the toughest of the three as well, especially away from home just sack race and new manager bouncing other but he has to will take Anna mean we've been saying this for a while and every time we win after we say people come back and go will never change a winning team, but the issue I have with that as I've had the whole time is at that winning team if they fit in their environment, so they're not going to win again like the reason you have the Squad the reason we've signed these plays irrespective whether they're better or worse than the players that we had. They're going to be fitted and they're going to be fresher and hopefully wanted to prove a point. So starting the same team hell or high water doesn't work in the fact that this has happened as you said the last two times Row three games to reach just proves that point. So hopefully you referenced in his press conference today that there's people chomping at the bit in the maybe changes. I hope you follow through on that because he really has to learn to do that because we ain't got the We know he's not gonna know that don't we? Yeah, he's I mean, he's not going to it's gonna be good Ally why because he kind of he's kind of hinted at it quite a few times. Yeah, and it just ends up being the same 11 and I think one pointed that I haven't really heard too many people say is we signed barely right all we sign them on loan. He was thrown straight into the side. I'm pretty sure you hadn't really played that that many minutes for for Bristol City before that soyuz thrown straight in the side and I Think he played what three or four games? I don't think he even came off as substitute then we played every minute and now he's out for the season with what was that? Ankle ligament injury? Yeah. We'll probably never see him again. Probably never see him again and and and that's almost certainly due to being thrown straight into the team in the play that that number of games in such a short space of time. We've got other players with big injury problems Charlie wake being a prime example, it wouldn't surprise me at all. If we have at least one other player who's out for the season some point. Well, you better like on barely right? Well, he's the first game he got chopped into was Tranmere on a sand pit. So players are going to pick up injuries like this and we went through this we've been through this before. It's like how is he keeping players like Scallon scoured like scoured Lafferty and all laugh at you gets minutes to the menu definitely will date and John's even exist and it's like, how is he keeping these players motivated when they know no matter what they do in training the not gonna get again. Never once had for me was like before the comment again. He admitted the gooch in white only just passed late Fitness tests to get in the first sight and like they were both should we stay off? The game white was particularly poor in my opinion, but why when you have the option to not start these two players bear in mind the play two games in the same seven days before they still starting. I just don't understand it. I mean Wieck, I'm not the biggest critic of Wieck. I know some people really like, you know, some people defend them a lot but like nobody could have watched him on Sunday. So that was a good performance because it really wasn't me look. Nothing is absolutely done in from the minutes and the moment that I think it's like 10 minutes in when he got elbowed in the face by this and the back from then on he didn't fancy and he just didn't fancy it any it didn't look for it anyway, and I wouldn't have been surprised. I know the last percent about how Denver Hume was Keen to get off when he got subbed off. I think if that happened to wipe on something he'd have been the same app. He almost looked like you needed the rest. So parking needs to read the they said we can see it. He should be able to see it. The problem we have now is because he's and I think you're a you've got a friend who's a boat and finally kind of alluded to this see picks his team and then he just grinds them down. Yeah, it's his point was that he picks players that buy into his into his vision and if you don't really buy into that Vision, you ain't gonna get a kick, but he said this happened at Bolton and and now we're at a point where pretty much Entire verse 11 need a rest so we can't we can't change the whole team and that would be a stupid thing to do and I don't think anybody would want him to do that. But what should have happened before now, is it he swapped out one or two? You know what we've got three games in a week. Some of those games are against who are opposition. I'm sure we could have swapped Dobson for scouring for one game lottery for white for one game just to keep and then they could come straight back in if that's what he wants to do. But now we're at a point where it's kind of gone on so far and then they've got if he does is that then the the players are coming in aren't like they don't feel like completely alien to the rest of the team. They know the system to play unless unless he's drilling every single player within an inch of their lives in training. So it's just they know their roles and the could just slip straight into it what it's like when I have seen these players covid, especially so many. Oh looks like he has no idea what he's meant to be doing and he's just well the straight of me so much when he came on it covered trick does Simply giving away silly fouls and it's damning my own argument here, but it says like they need to be gradually introduced or introduced somehow. So when they come in they do know exactly what they're doing. I think I mentioned this on the last part actually, I think one of the major issues with the way he's treating the squad is that it almost sends a message to well one message to the starting eleven and another message to the players on the bench and so far as like no matter what you do if you're a Started you're going to start and no matter what you do, if you're not starting you're not going to start and then it's like for these players who haven't come on the bench and try and show something 5-10 minutes, like after sort of two months, especially the ones I've just been signed lease Council menu, for example, it's like what you've just signed me and you're not really giving me a chance to do anything else and I'm lucky if I get 5 10 minutes and then I feel like I've got to try and do everything to impress you and it's like fair enough don't change a winning team blah blah, but the same time the argument is also is what kind of message is the same. The Lads want get in the game. Is it like well, you're just a buckle. I'm not gonna cite you then. How is that going to motivate them to try and put in their best performance and also make it they're going to be rusty like you say in so many you look worse than a surprise and but it's like you take laughter laughter T. For example, people have been saying oh, well, he's not start engaged because he's not fit. Well, how are you supposed to get like match ready? When you have five minutes here five minutes there when you come on you you're essentially do it. You're either doing the same job. As why Corps playing alongside Wieck, which makes because makes no difference like no sense whatsoever lumbees is to play them both up front and another lump it up to them. Basically that that that is our only other option A teams and departments and that's because it's just like this bizarre because it happened on it happened on Saturday or Sunday. Sorry, we brought two of them on it's like when you have a ready-made like a little man, but you know, we like the big man little man Jenna Thing. Whoo, if the big man win, It could knock it. Knock it down to someone and he might do something. I know well Craig you can't just make him good because he's not been playing who said hey, come on, give it a go. Give me a go. Definitely. I think not obviously not not great for might one Wednesday before the newly plate new Syne plays one thing that really annoys you about managers and we've had a few that in recent times as managers who sign players and then don't play. It's like you're saying these players you said you need to improve the squad you've got them in and then you're not using them so like will either you've you've signed for a players or you're just not using them anyway, which neither argument makes sense really and I just can't understand it because if I'm one of those players I'm thinking about what the hell of a sound for someone from not getting the game in no matter what I do in trade and especially, you know, definitely John can look at them behave and he's you can say well Humes not played well for three four games in your I'm not even getting on the bench what I'm not what I'm gonna do and I think also the fact that he did thrillbilly right straighten the team Just stop if you think you're good enough or you're a better option than you probably would be in the same. So game or message. Does that send mixed messages? Because then you could argue that Bailey Wright came down for the championship. But so does Scout Bailey Wright was thrown straight in scans. I've what went up to 20 minutes in someone's career so far exactly. So he'll he'll if I was him I'd be thinking well, if you thought I was good enough like they clearly thought Bailey Wright was a better option than the nas to or Lynch. He put it straight in but he hasn't put me straight in so he obviously doesn't think I'm as a good enough. Well that brings us to he said today in his press conference that Lem Burton and Ethan Robson are in contention which makes you wonder so what like does it so so what so they can like not going to Squad all I ever but it's embleton. I mean he was he was pretty good actually before he went. We've already pulled his hamstring at Sheffield United all those months ago another big fan favorite despite not doing much but you know, You never know you put him in that's another option. But as he said does he was even going to use these options sick one of them at one of the main problems and what we had previously was McGee D because McGee was arguably the only other player who plays a similar role to what he plays you can see McGwire could do it as well. But McGwire could play another positions, but you know, and I mean that the reports from Grimsby last year, if you look at the stats, even you know, like these non swollen dfl podcasts or raved about and long last he's no good. He was a Grimsby saying that he definitely is good enough. To play in ligue 1 Sutherland and I think he is as well. I mean for me he gives you something a bit different because if you look at how we played for England under-17s on the 19z was one of the best players in that in those teams. He hasn't lost that ability. He's like being unlucky with injuries, but for me and we'll definitely if it deserves a chance because it gives us some different. I mean technically he is probably better than virtually any other player number 10 in ligue 1 purely because of the what we've With England and when he's been on learning was too good for League to last season of goons the standards not that much better and leave one for a lot of teams. That would imagine certainly he at least deserves a chance as for Ethan Robson. I'm not sure if he has got anything that we haven't got I mean George Dobson's younger than him and it's starting ahead of him and in my eyes as a better player than in nothing against Robson, but I'm not sure if maybe he needs a change of scene. Oh Rob's incite what 24 now it's like you say. If you want to made it, I know he's had injuries and all this. It seems to be a recurring theme with something new for us apart from Denver Hume who is play quite a lot now, but it's like when we always hear of this like embleton as and I he's going to be fantastic and then he's just like, oh plays a few games. He looks good snap time string and he's out for like six months and it's like With Robson remember when he played in the championship, so I wasn't too keen on him, but it's another option. Then it is that you - coward but idea about scones guy. Who's this guy? No, I agree. I think that what I've seen available and I think he deserves something that he could probably offer at the sides in one of those kind of wide forward areas instead of Gucci McGuire, but he isn't going to be isn't going to change it and he's only got you can't just like pile as many people as you want on the bench. There's a finite amount of places we can have on there be any color McLaughlin needs his spot. Well, I mean there were taught and other They Came Upon the pods earlier in the week and I totally agree and it's a good point about human the fact that he's but he's young and he's inexperienced and he probably does need a brave for the side. But the the backup option seems to be linen Gooch. It also needs a rest and Elton John's absolutely nowhere to be seen so he's clearly not going to come straight into the side that just wouldn't happen. But those pictures there was pictures of him on the club's website, so he does exist and he's clearly well if he's training he must be fit so I'm sure he said if he's injured I mean he was saying that like he's he's ready to go and it's like well, why did you know been no one in the problem for me is like yes, I agree that humans look great. And he probably does need a break but deckhand John was playing for Swansea under 21. So we signed it means I've played I don't know if he's ever played, you know in ligue 1 he played a bit in the challenge. I don't think he's played that many first team in this at all if he gets just blown into her. An intense must-win game for his, you know, having on the back of absolutely no to of even Cameo Rose of the bench or anything. It's a big ask and for me, it's one of them where the gooks thing is interesting with him because I kind of get it if we're chasing the game because like you want to keep your attacking players on the pitch. So you move Goods as you know will move forward anyway, but at the same time, The absolute issue is that the the mini humors effectively and up will because there's nobody else who can play there and the reason why that's happened is because death and John hasn't been given the opportunity even in you know to come on or he's only been on the been so why is he not being introduced for human the past so that if you need to start you can yeah, I mean, I don't want to do all that kind of cast aspersions, but it could it be a problem with application you do sometimes get an issue with play. Those who come on loan who know that they haven't got the know that Alvin got an opportunity probably to go of that club permanently, whether they want to or whether the club doesn't want to take them and particularly since he hasn't been he has been featuring at all. He's very unlikely to be at Sunderland. Next season is e so is he really going to want to be thrown into the roles of a promotion race and would we really want throw him in there either? He's there just as well the fucking point of I hear he's probably been told by Swansea right? You're not You're not going to play for us in the second half of the Season Sutherland of come in feeling alone. We suggest you go there. If you don't go there you're not going to play for us. If you go there you might get some minutes and he's probably thought well, I'll go point. I mean, I don't get it like Madonna cast aspersions, but at the same time it's like is there a reason he's not getting picked him in parks and seems much. He doesn't change the team at the same time. He does seem to reward the players who do work hard. So I don't know it's weird. He hasn't even been on the bench where cop kind of McLaughlin who is you know, I've seen people refer to Charlie Wieck is the Tin Man up front, but I think the defensive equivalent will be kind of McLaughlin. So I don't know why he's getting on the benches of wing back cover ahead of Dellinger. So in short you expecting the same team on Saturday. I am but I don't know whether he might feel one changing because I really really do think that Charlie Wieck. Needs to not start the next game at least similar similar. Yeah, he'll start same team unless you know presumably they'll be more lit fitness test. If somebody doesn't pass one of them, he'll make a change and if if everybody gets a clean bill of health and fitness, he will start same 11. That's a good enough point for a break after the break we'll beloved quick chat about the the running to the end of the season. And welcome back to the wise men say preview show plug time Jim. Do you like jumpers? I I do. I really do like jumpers. What kind of jumpers do you like? Well, I like sort of jumpers that you can wear on a night out on a nice day out or maybe even to the football. Oh to the football. You say do you like polo shirts Matthew? Yeah, really like polishes. I like them in different colors. Yeah. I've got several animals rope. Oh, yeah. Yeah polo shirts I live. Publisher you live it polishes. That's great. That's great. Because I tell you where you can get polo shirt and jumpers to wear to the club and to the football match and through really nice jackets as that's a really nice jacket. Don't forget the jacket from The Terraces a from The Terraces stop. Codon UK of every.com. Don't know don't quote me on that. And if you go there do you want some money off it you can get some bloody money off it promo code WMS 10. So when you got Jill Ingham, well you go to the Jillian game on Saturday you can And look absolutely shit hot before you got a chilling game. Where could you like show off your new fangled like garments? Well the way country I've heard a rumor that cracking pre-match show. Oh, yes done before the game featuring Danny Collins. Yeah. I'm very hard from the future head serving peas pudding and ham sandwiches is going to be played again or but featuring Deron Williams this time Deron Williams that ladies feel that Let Middlesbrough all those years ago. Fantastic. Fantastic beers. Where is it? Jim? It is the peacock the peacock what time's it start starts? Well, I believe you know start a half one. You can get there from half twelve onwards upstairs. And honestly, I did go last time. It's absolutely cracking. I've not met Darren Williams before but as we said on Monday, but he's got some great stories. So I'm quite excited and I am Matthew. Yeah, these free free style cakes imagine that well, yeah, it sounds it sounds great. I'd love to meet Darren Williams and what else? Is thing what else is this? Oh Shipyard for three pounds. Well, so get yourself down down to the peacock pre-drilling him and also unfortunately Gareth and Stephen also be there hosting and yeah, you can have this but in front of you I mean how great would that be great. Anyway, okay, we're going to the what they call the business end of the season and the question is with v. Now how many points? Done. We are just a cache line fifth place just a casual or six points off the top but also for points of second place and level on points. Have we left it too late? No, I really don't think we have a did do then I listened to Monday's Wiseman sleep on Gareth. I thought not not just going everybody but especially growth was speaking a lot of sense about not getting Too carried away with the negativity. There's a lot of football still to play. I think we I mean obviously mathematically it's still it would be in our hands regardless by I actually do think that if you look at the comparative runs of us of what we've got compared to what the other side so I think it is definitely doable. But also at the same time, we really do have to now not miss any more opportunities to really put our foot on the gas at one point. Stephen said on Monday every time we Get an opportunity to put our foot on the gas machine to mess it up and that that is a hundred percent true. And I think we will get opportunities again this season and we really cannot afford especially with the potential breaks that we're going to have coming up in the games and we have to play the team in front of us and nothing more is pointless this the club looking ahead and decide looking ahead to thinking wouldn't go when we've got to be Jillian first. We've got to beat Wimbledon first. We've got big, you know, we've got to just play The Mazda come I know every footballer says it in the post match interview that you can take it again at a time, but it is really really true in key at this point that we do that I think we have left it too late. Sorry night and day that nine-day. I know I know yeah Gareth and and Via him Jim of put forward a good case, but I just think we're not enthused by that passionate ya know and I hope people are and I hope people are I think it's totally fine and I've totally see the logic we can still do it course we can. Do it but me personally I don't think we will now head in in the last two games. I was sort of willing to believe that we can do it if we got four or maybe even six points from those two games. I thought yeah, we could do it to end up with 1 point from those two games and very nearly end up with no points. I think is is really poor from that sort of double header and we were all talking about it being a big test playing some good teams in form and we Been found wanting to be honest, but would be for those two games. Were you confident? We could like getting top to know not real skeptical before those two games and I thought if this company up to games are because of the running because of the because of what had happened before alien the fact that we were in good form. We were playing well and we're getting good results, but so are a lot of teams around us and I think some of those teams are still inform. I'm not saying we're not inform necessarily but The last two games, I think we'll just such a big opportunity. And and I think I think we have left it too late to be honest. And that that first 12 foot in games under Parkinson has really it's really just put us so far behind from where we would have been if we just picked up a few more points that time we would have been top to I think if it comes down to it we do end up in the playoffs. I think this is what we're going to be looking at that aw. Awful October to December period where we've gone to write bad defeats Shrewsbury chilling him then horrible drawers, but bolt see if you win that game the Bolton per se you on 61 points and that's only a point off the like second and then it's like that everyone's like game but I do think I understand your pessimism their book. This is not a good League. It's not like it's not like last year. Where you'd look every week and Abby Barnes you Lutsen Charlton live one. Whereas now it's like oh rather have drawn against Wimbledon as I MK Dons. I got a point at the Brewers of like this so I don't personally I don't well as I was saying before I didn't predict any of this a of his winning every single game and it still has to finish second. Obviously, we're not going to win every game but I do think inconsistencies of the teams around us like poor. From the gun actually minging run and that also they'll probably like hungover from like beating Salford in the checkatrade and I think they could slip I don't I couldn't hang my hat on anyone to go bar possibly carpentry. I think fundamentally, I honestly can't think of it one side. We played this season who I actually have thought. Wow, you know, they're even as good as we are. I mean, I think obviously we've been beaten and me. Played badly, but at the same time, you know even come to him someday, there's supposedly on form the best side in the league and the winner Peterborough would probably the best I've seen but we all know they go hot and cold and he was can't rely on them to do that fluid. So don't feel like I've been sniffing say in this instance even running the championship many wallets every week. So the tears were coming up against these are not good teams, but not going the sense. They're not playing swashbuckling football that kind of surprise you but it's like It's just doing enough. It's like Coventry it just doing enough. They're not blowing teams away. It's like don't forget. We're doing that against Oxford. Yeah. Yes, of course, we're doing that against MK Dons. And in other games. Well admittedly we didn't do it on something. We didn't play well, but at the same time, I just don't see at this point a lot like awakened and I know Matt put forward a good argument for it, but I just don't see how you can say would definitely nothing. They're not going to do it at this point. This is too much too much but mostly played in is too many bang average seems in good positions. Yeah, I definitely don't think we're definitely not going to do it. How can I don't know I can totally I can totally see us doing it, but we're either going to do it or not and I like I'm yeah, correct. Exactly. Yeah, there's two possible outcomes will either do it or we won't and I personally think we will win a lot of games between now and the end of the season will will be will be there. Although I do want to say there. They're about summer and in towns and we will be up there. I'm sure but a but I just don't think we'll quite manage it well, but it this way Connor this time next week out of it Thursday. No, sorry week on Sunday. St. Patrick's Day if you will. Well, these three games are out the way we've got nine points from that and then we don't have another game for like series like a mob. If you got nine points from these next three games anything kid, right? This is definitely on because I think it's I think it would come through we come through these next three games win all of them. I think yeah, possibly because I think teams around us and I miss little because they've got some of them got to play each other and they're like Peter and Portsmouth have to play each other at some point. I'm pretty sure Robin laughter rather enough to play Peter Brook for Portsmouth, or maybe even though from as well, unfortunately. Auntie, I think we're going to have to look out for which ominously hovering below us is Fleetwood because they they're on they've come from nowhere bit like the dawn what Lou and did but at a much later phase in the season where since New Year just this smashed everyone in the top foot top six and it's just like they keep that momentum building as Bears me to say you don't want to be ended up with them in the playoffs. I can't say that I'm with him and Other than that, I really didn't implode or something volatile. I just think it is a volatile environment. I think when it's good, it's good ones, but it's balanced under him similar probably to up to when we had Roy Keane stuff and I just whoa whoa. Whoa, let's not directly say no compelling. No, but I mean in terms of you know volatility. I just I just like amateurs Fleetwood are obviously doing well. I can't at this point see them as a serious Contender to get proposed. I might be wrong. But I would love just caught this big and turn will cut this bit on the adame. So we can Replay that when they're parading the trophy round really making a fishermen's friend that Factory around their salute written that around unfortunately, we're gonna have to talk. Well Donald's been at it again. He's been talking to some Sunland fans outside outside somewhere of social club or something of that ilk and the Papers picked up on it. And apparently there's major interest again and that he's gone. All he's all going to be is all going to go through Lads but you know the dreams going to complete and just so tired of this. Yeah. I mean in all honesty, I think at this point over some of the season anyway, but I think at this point with Sunderland and the ownership and that we've had I'd rather not be here in about that, especially not you know and Motorway service stations or whatever is that we heard it I mean I've been saying for a long time and I'm not by any means the only one and I'm certainly not trying to be overly critical it critically because I actually don't want to be critical of the current leadership. But at the same time I feel I must say that I struggle to deal with the mixed messages that we get in the the lack of consistent communication and you know, we've been told it was getting so again the February been told there was interested buyers and towards the end of the season. It's like frankly at this point. I think we just need to to stop hearing from the chairman until the end of the season. It's also like Matthew. It's like it's going to be what another sigh. Can you remember like in your last remember summer where Sunland weren't on the brink of being taken over? I mean he say when he did that talksport interview. I can't remember exactly when it was and he said it'll take a month or two I think and I was kind of skeptical at the time. I mean, it sounds like Very short period of time to sell a football club particularly when you've pretty much gone from allegedly a point of the point of not wanting to sell the club to a point of selling the club to think that you can get it done and dusted in four to eight weeks seems like a very tight turnaround, so I didn't really believe that at the time and obviously that that would have been like sort of end of February I think and that's passed now and so I don't really I don't really take a lot of notice anymore to be honest at this point. With all the mixed messages. We just got to see what happens. Just just boring. Isn't it? Just like added sell it or I don't well then done something a little brighter. Well Brian might be boring. I don't really care but it's like we're right we've got night kits next year. That's that's exciting it is it and apparently although the plan where the making them all they all have coronavirus now, so so maybe we'll get the first coronavirus shirt, which would be quite cool. Apparently this season is going to be Template so we're going to get our own snazzy. Like Nigeria style should look like yeah the first coronavirus first coronavirus ship the first team that gets coronavirus. Oh, by the way, if anyone listen to the does have coronavirus, we wish you all the best Joe thinking is that what this is we had we had night kits while we had him in the early 90s. They were some some find kids and then also documented on One of my best areas with Quentin Phillips in that white lovely white shirts, but we've got our question of the week. Unfortunately. See it's touching on our beloved owners again. As you know suddenly until I die to comes out on April Fool's Day, which is funny 473 the makers of it tweeted the announcement of some until I die with the hashtag the Donald methvin show quickly taken down and had to apologize for that and hopefully these answers won't require us to do the same in that Spirit of the Donald messenger show. What would you name a TV series starring Charlie metal and Stuart Donald and what would they? I'd like to see a sort of imagining of what might happen after they sell the club maybe Stewart Donald goes back to working in car insurance and it would be called Always the bridal never the bride. Let's get there's no way I'm going to top that. I mean my my imagining I mean I sort of an odd does anything slanderous ended up just imagining like them on I'm more like current current TV show. So I thought like maybe like an episode of celebrity coach trip featuring Donald Donald methane on a on a coach trip around Europe with some of the sort of Zelda list celebrities, or maybe Top Gear hosts. They sort of Like I feel like they might well, in fact is we don't give we do have the best away transport in the legally. So so so, you know, you get the someone can organize the coach for the coach chip and it could be like them and like dick and Dom and no other Duos or you could have a bit of Top Gear but I think if we're going to have a new show, it would be sort of a fly on the wall sort of like Crossing out of the thick of it in the office following Charlie method is PR Company. We're like, he's like doing the actual Job, and then there's like throw a few actors in and obviously it goes. Well Joe friend of the show Jose written in he suggested traffic cops where the method where the minimum five you because speeding is a hundred points, which is very good. I also had Donnie in the chinos to glamorous Jewel thieves, but he said if thieves and Jules, it's just they just go around we can three pints everywhere. Okay predictions for Saturday Matthew I think will win to now Sunil I think the same tune. I think I'll buy three nil and finally will the big one will we go up? Yes. Yes, but by the playoffs and we say yes. Last day away it rather be in Rotherham to go up. You also do the New York stadium in the in New York, New York jungle where dreams are made of? I don't know. They'll be here reaction pod on Saturday at the Jillian game, and they'll be a normal part again on Monday. Thanks for listening.
