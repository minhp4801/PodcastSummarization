Yeah, so so, yeah, but if there is a single Hood, but by Bye-bye. See people go Donna. What do you think is the reason why girls feel so bad about singlehood? Number one media hmm music. Yeah movies TV culture and our culture. It's it's how this world will always use romance as a means of redemption and payments so tall, but you see it in you see everywhere. I don't even have to count or give specific mean just go to Netflix and you have any Latin happy ending when the boy and the girl gets together. Yeah are about of there's some sort of salvation.

NE. They have more single he'll do whatever I want a party as spend on myself L travel alone meet so many people. Okay sure about your feet to do that. But this woman May coach. She says I see my singlehood as a season to build community to give back to do. Advocacy work. Oh my God, there's so much. She's doing something meaningful with her time because I guess if you also view your time at something borrowed from God something that's also a gift from the Lord. Yeah it by but you wanna all way you don't want to use it for selfish reasons. Yeah, not just selfish not to self is young, but I think about it. I was never taken on trips to that or do this the by enjoy the little mama treat yourself moments, right? Of course, not of course, these are Beneficial to the bar but on a bigger scale bigger scheme of things on the bigger scheme of things the but it's really stewardship stewardship and reflecting the goodness of Christ to others that will give you real Joy. Another thing. I would like to point out other than the media and the culture making romance some sort of Savior is that these girls do Know any better? Yeah, no one has to model do them that singleness is a great way to live life. No one has really purposefully stood up in front of them and said God doesn't owe me a love life. Yeah the bar you're not entitled to getting married in this lifetime. Why and it's of course, I guess because we're Christians do but it's a calling emerges a very difficult calling at that exactly.

Yeah, you know, it's just this Spartacus. Our culture has seen marriage as just the next step of AIDS hbase say print on India parent Castle, but who says who says yeah. Yeah. There's just this thick toxic pressure culture around us. Yeah, just because you're just because the world has done it that way doesn't mean everyone there. There's a template there's our youth.
