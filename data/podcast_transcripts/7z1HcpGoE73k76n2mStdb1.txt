Hello, this is your everyday positivity on Vale. My name is Kate kocher today. I'm going to be celebrating the life and grieving the passing of my husband's grandmother. And it means we get to spend the day with family people. We've not seen for a long time. We get to share stories about this woman that was in our life and so important to many of us and I wanted to just acknowledge that story and memory are so deeply. Intertwined and that today I know we're going to have a great time sharing stories about this woman that we're grieving and sharing stories about good times and sharing stories about the quirks and the Ridiculousness of humans and human nature. And so today I want you to kind of join me not just with the people that have passed away in your life, but I want you to celebrate your memories. I want you to celebrate. Stories and the things that you hold dear to you and I want you to enjoy today telling yourself those memories and allowing yourself to reminisce in times of good and in doing that you will feel good and positive about your life right now. So today is all about celebrating your memories and your stories and taking what is Good from your life and those around you I'll be back. Tomorrow and on Sunday with a journal entry in the meantime.
