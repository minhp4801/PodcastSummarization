This is your everyday positivity here on Vale. Hello. I'm Kate Crocker. I hope you're well today. Do you think you are challenging yourself enough? I had a moment this week with my coach about accountability and I was really surprised. It's always really surprising when you think I've got that bit sorted and I'm always really good at that and then someone asks you a question and you go always like that. I think I'm good at that or the time actually good at that so I have been challenged this week and And it's hard. It's hard pushing yourself through those challenges. It feels uncomfortable you get that vulnerable feeling around your heart and you your instinct says right. I need to move away from this. I don't want to go there t harv Eker in his book. The millionaire mindset says life gets easy when you do the hard stuff and challenging yourself is about doing the hard stuff. So something is really challenging you at the moment leaning take it on and know that when you come out the other side. Forget that bit easier. I will be back tomorrow with another episode of everyday positivity. In the meantime have a great and challenge yourself kind of a day. If you enjoy the everyday positivity podcast.
