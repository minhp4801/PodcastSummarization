This is episode number 12 to this word will be read from John 15 verses 9 through 17. As the father has loved me. So have I Loved You Now remain in my love. If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love just as I have kept my father's commands and remain in his love I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete. My command is this love each other as I have loved you greater love has no one than this to lay down one's life for As friends you are my friends. If you do what I command I no longer call you servants because a servant does not know his master's business instead of called you friends for everything that I learned from my father. I have made known to you you did not choose me but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit fruit that will last and so that whatever you ask in my name the father will give you the this is my command love each other in the word of the Lord has blessed after that you continue to be covered by his grace his mercy and his peace.
