Wealth from get-rich-quick schemes quickly disappears. Well from hard work grows over time Proverbs 13 11. I read a story recently about a 24 year old who went to visit a financial planner the financial planner asked to see her spending habits the author of the article shared that through to over the phone sessions in a couple of weeks of financial reflection. She found that she didn't have to give up things. She really loved to save money that realization helped her get past Financial anxiety and helped her to make productive spending cuts during the sessions. Which each lasted about an hour they discussed her background shared screens to look at a monthly credit card statement and addressed goals for the week. The financial accountability was intended to help her prepare and save for the future. It's encouraging to know that the Bible is full of wise advice on how to handle and how to view Money In fact money is mentioned hundreds of times in the Bible including the verse from Proverbs we heard today. Let's hear it again wealth from get-rich-quick schemes quickly disappears. Well from hard work grows over time. It's also important to remember Words of Jesus to when I plan for my financial future to invest in things of the Kingdom that will reap and eternal reward. Not just an Earthly one as I go throughout my day to day. I'm going to pay closer attention to how I'm spending the money. The father has blessed me with I hope you'll join me. Have a blessed day.
