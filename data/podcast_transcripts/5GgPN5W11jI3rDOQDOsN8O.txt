Hello, beautiful people and welcome to waking youth. My name is got a lotta gibberish. I'll be your host and I have to say I'm extremely happy to be here with you today. And in this episode, I'll just be introducing waking youth. How did I come up with this idea? And what waking youth is all about so over the summer I was listening to a lot of podcasts and I was thinking that I really wanted to work and focus on my creativity and when I started the semester I amThird-year communication student in Spain. I was also looking for an initiative and I was feeling very stressed and very anxious and I realized that a lot of my friends were also feeling like this because we're obviously we're very young and we are not so sure of what are we good at already and what we want to do what type of organizations do we want to work for? So I thought why not actually do a podcast precisely about this about being young about being a little a bit lost but also about having so many ideas and so many thoughts and so many so much Drive in life, but kind of feeling uncertain about the future. So if you're into personal development, if you're into psychology philosophy, if you're into exploring the possibilities of the future and questioning what Society takes for granted, I think this is what waking youth is all about is about feeling this uneasiness, but wanting to feel inspired to be the best version of yourself if this Wow, sounds like you I invite you to start this journey with me and I hope you enjoy as much as I'm enjoying doing this podcast. I'll be inviting several friends professors or just people that inspire me really do you have open vulnerable authentic conversations? But I'll also be talking and I'll be doing some episodes on my own as well exploring different themes. So I hope you stay tuned and I wish you a beautiful day.
