What's up, everybody? It is Brian Ford with self-improvement daily. Take ownership of your personal development one tip at a time today. I'm featuring a special individual who also is our next self-improvement sit down guest. His name is Alex Sheen and he is the founder of the nonprofit because I said I would the mission of the charity is to give people the resources and accountability. They need to live with courage and honor. I'll get into more detail about because I said it would in the interview, but for now, let's learn an important lesson Central to Alex's Mission promises are serious, and they shouldn't be taken lightly. We need to make promises only when we mean them have a listen. So if you look at Merriam-Webster Dictionary A promise is a statement telling someone you'll definitely do something or something will certainly happen in the future you touched on something that's incredibly important and not always intuitive is how important and the courage of no is you can't make everybody happy, you know people pleasing at its core is a good thing, right? You have an intention to help others to do good in this world to make people happy. That's that's not bad. But if we're making a bunch of promises that we can't keep or won't keep we're disappointing people along the way and we're not doing favors for anyone I know right now is going to be a lot less heartache than a broken promise. Later. In the interview we go on to talk about how we make promises every day just by saying yes and how dangerous that is for the relationships and expectations around us. You won't want to miss the interview. It's coming out this Sunday and it will inspire you. I am so grateful for this opportunity and I thank you for joining me. I'll see you next time on self-improvement daily.
