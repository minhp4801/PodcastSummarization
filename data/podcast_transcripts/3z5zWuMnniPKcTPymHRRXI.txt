It looks like there's going to be a lady Loki in the upcoming Disney plus series after all there have been new set photos revealed on Twitter by at BR Marvel news showing Sofia demartino dressed in a black suit with the green and gold that is a dead giveaway for Loki. This was a rumor that was circulating not long ago, but was never actually confirmed now looks like that's exactly what we'll be getting. This also leads us to wonder whether we'll be seeing a kid Loki as well as both a child and Lady versions of loci or straight out of the comics. In fact, he's changed his form quite a few times after being brought back to them dead. And it looks like we're getting at least two versions so will be fun to see what else we might see in the upcoming Loki. Are you excited about the upcoming series?
