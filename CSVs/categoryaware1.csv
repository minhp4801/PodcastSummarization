As I have argued previously, Bitcoin is a living organisms, but where does this organism live exactly? As with many questions in the world of Bitcoin, exact answers are hard to come by. Living things have fuzzy edges, beginnings and endings are hard, differentiation is more or less arbitrary, and what was classified as a wolf today might evolve to be a dog tomorrow. Bitcoin has no rigid specification, no absolute finality, no fixed development team, no final security guarantees, no scheduled updates, no central brain, no centralized vision, no kings and no rulers. It is a decentralized organism organically evolving without central planners. The lack of any centralization is the source of Bitcoin's organic behavior and its resilience.
