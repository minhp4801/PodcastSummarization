But you simply cannot ignore his work. Walt Disney once famously said that ""Laughter is America's greatest export,"" but well, it's not actually travel and transportation. With 236 billion dollars in sales in 2017, the sale of intellectual property including TV and movies, this amounts to 49 billion dollars, which is still big indeed. It's twice the GDP of Cyprus. So, if by laughter we mean entertainment, then yes, American entertainment is one of the country's most important export.

Some stories maintained that the child was born a monster. Others claim it was born as a typical baby. Its progression to fanged beast happened over time, whether immediate or gradual. However, its eventual form is always the same. Bat-like wings, a goat-like head, a forked tail, horns, and claws. It Yelps one time only, and then craws up the chimney and flies into the forest. The monster was originally called the Leads Devil before becoming known as the Jersey Devil, and as it turns out, Mother Leeds may have actually existed in a will dated February 5th, 1736. A man named ""Japhet Leads"" refers to his wife Deborah Leads. In fact, at least 12 that were recorded. But while we may have found proof that the Leeds family existed, concrete evidence of their 13th child has been more difficult to come by.",1,bartpodcasts

It was through her practice that she was able to truly see him for who he was, with an open heart before he unfortunately passed in 2013. We talked about how she left a job in the music industry and started working at the Chopra Center for two and a half years. After that stint, after rebalancing her mind, body, and spirit, she took a leap of faith to move back to LA and start teaching the practice. Like I said, she says it's saved her life and she hopes that it can change all of ours as well.

This is something that we both have discussed often in our friendship as we talk about other crazy spiritual encounters and experiences that we've had, but it's crucial that we felt it was truly important and timely to have a serious conversation that is also seasoned with humanity. We don't have to be afraid to approach those who are mentally ill. We need to be able to approach Jesus with our mental illnesses, like this is all a part of the power of the Gospel.  This is all of the compassion of Christ for his kids. We have kids as young as 4 dealing with anxiety and stuff like that, so I think it's appropriate and time-ly for us to have this conversation. I'm really glad you're here.
