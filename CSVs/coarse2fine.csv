5KNJcwdo2eSDR5Est1Jw2l,"Mechanical Advantage Drop Sets (MADS) are a type of drop sets in which the variable is not the weight, but the exercises you perform with that weight. The higher incline is mechanically harder to set up into a mechanical advantage drop set, but you can complete an impressive number of reps, allowing you to increase time under tension without a decrease in weight. You can start for example with a wide grip pull up with your hands pronated and your arms splayed out. This is the weakest mechanical position based on which muscles will be at work in the exercise, as well as how the leverage of your arms will come into play. This leads us to mechanical advantage drops, or MADS, in which you place less emphasis on the chest and more on the smaller, weaker muscles of the shoulders. Dr. Neal is right in that lifting with heavy weights is one of the best ways to build muscle fast. And so I love the idea of instead of dropping the weight which I've talked about before, when doing pyramids or ladders, instead, you keep the same heavyweight, just maybe change the angle or change your hand position. You start with a more difficult position and with the same weight.",2,coarse2fine
