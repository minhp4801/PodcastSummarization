Your body is in energy, your thoughts are also an energy, and your emotions are energy. So we are bunch of energy beings who are immersed in an energy pool.

Let's go ahead and jump into the read and then we'll talk a little bit about it afterward. Bitcoin's habitats, how Bitcoin is surviving and thriving between worlds. As I have argued previously, Bitcoin is a living organisms, but where does this organism live exactly? As with many questions in the world of Bitcoin, exact answers are hard to come by. Living things have fuzzy edges, beginnings and endings are hard, differentiation is more or less arbitrary, and what was classified as a wolf today might evolve to be a dog tomorrow. Bitcoin has no rigid specification, no absolute finality, no fixed development team, no final security guarantees, no scheduled updates, no central brain, no centralized vision, no kings and no rulers. It is a decentralized organism organically evolving without central planners. The lack of any centralization is the source of Bitcoin's organic behavior and its resilience. Bitcoin is everywhere and nowhere, which makes figuring out where this thing lives a daunting task. However, it turns out that there is a space it lives in multiple spaces.",2,categoryaware1

Fed Chairman Powell basically indicated that the virus and the measures that are being taken to contain it will surely impact economic activity both in the US and abroad for some time. This came earlier than scheduled March FOMC meeting, but clearly illustrates what we said about the FED being cornered in to a 50 basis cut by market.

We will go through a progressive relaxation and release any and all resistance and tension that is building up in your body.

And if you are standing, have your feet flat on the ground and ankles lined up with your knees. Once you find either you're sitting or laying position with your hands, I want you to find your navel.

The influence of Walt Disney on today's popular culture and collective imagination cannot be understated. You could love him, you can hate him, or you can love to hate him.

Millennials change jobs after one year. One myth that some might not know or even care to disprove is that millennials jump from job to job because we're never satisfied.

You just need to have your positives outweigh the negatives in serving and volleying. I never hear people talk about the negatives by the way of serving and staying back. Here's why when players stay back there, they're super happy and they lose. They start focusing on all the mistakes that they use to not make when they stay back and they start missing high volleys. You start getting more frustrated. You've got to start winning more points, second. So please practice your service and volley. Practice being a wall at the net.

5KNJcwdo2eSDR5Est1Jw2l,"Mechanical Advantage Drop Sets (MADS) are a type of drop sets in which the variable is not the weight, but the exercises you perform with that weight. The higher incline is mechanically harder to set up into a mechanical advantage drop set, but you can complete an impressive number of reps, allowing you to increase time under tension without a decrease in weight. You can start for example with a wide grip pull up with your hands pronated and your arms splayed out. This is the weakest mechanical position based on which muscles will be at work in the exercise, as well as how the leverage of your arms will come into play. This leads us to mechanical advantage drops, or MADS, in which you place less emphasis on the chest and more on the smaller, weaker muscles of the shoulders. Dr. Neal is right in that lifting with heavy weights is one of the best ways to build muscle fast. And so I love the idea of instead of dropping the weight which I've talked about before, when doing pyramids or ladders, instead, you keep the same heavyweight, just maybe change the angle or change your hand position. You start with a more difficult position and with the same weight.",2,coarse2fine

Her mission was to dismantle the Clermont-Rivière Group, a group of French soldiers who were responsible for bringing France to the brink of destruction. She was trained in hand-to-hand combat, but she also developed extensive knowledge on explosive devices, and was able to think her way out of any situation, keeping a cool head and a quick wit in even the most stressful environments. Although she was completely dedicated to her cause, Pearl never relished the idea of using violence in the field.

Lewis' classic film The Manchurian Candidate.

Of course. The stoics were materialists and so Cicero is not saying that the mind is made of matter nor is he saying that stoics practice can somehow make people in vulnerable to pain even the sage sage. But it is empirically true that people experience even physical pain. Let alone emotional pain differently depending on how they frame the situation in their mind.",2,bartcnn

Fed Chairman Powell basically indicated that the virus and the measures that are being taken to contain it will surely weigh on economic activity both in the US and abroad for some time. This came earlier than scheduled March FOMC meeting, but clearly illustrates what we said about the Fed being cornered in to a 50 bps cut by market. The question that remains is where will the Fed go from here? If you reference the G7 meeting of finance chiefs, that actually felt to reveal more than verbal jawboning, so our senses look to the market reaction. Wall Street quickly sold off while US Treasury bonds got an adrenaline boost. We saw the two-year yield rise to 20.7% in US and the 10-year treasury yield dipping his toes to 1% handle.

When you have a feeling of worry wash over you, when you have an feeling of anger wash through you, or despair, or overwhelm, or frustration, or anger, or fear, or sadness, or depression, or anxiety, or hopelessness, or even fear, all they mean is that you are thinking about something quite differently than who you really are and what you really think.

With 236 billion dollars in sales in 2017, the sale of intellectual property including TV and movies, this amounts to 49 billion dollars, which is still big indeed. It's twice the GDP of Cyprus. So, if by laughter we mean entertainment, then yes, American entertainment is one of the country's most important export.

While the goals of each are clearly different, the essential frame of mind is strikingly similar.",2,bartpodcasts

However, its eventual form is always the same. Bat-like wings, a goat-like head, a forked tail, horns, and claws. It Yelps one time only, and then craws up the chimney and flies into the forest. The monster was originally called the Leads Devil before becoming known as the Jersey Devil, and as it turns out, Mother Leeds may have actually existed in a will dated February 5th, 1736.

This is something that we both have discussed often in our friendship as we talk about other crazy spiritual encounters and experiences that we've had, but it's crucial that we felt it was truly important and timely to have a serious conversation that is also seasoned with humanity. We don't have to be afraid to approach those who are mentally ill. We need to be able to approach Jesus with our mental illnesses, like this is all a part of the power of the Gospel.  This is all of the compassion of Christ for his kids.

We all have to make some pretty life changing sacrifices to stand where we are standing now, where we would like to stand later. For instance, when I decided to go back to school to become a nurse practitioner, I had to make amazing sacrifices in order to get through that. In fact, it was so difficult for me that after the first or second semester, I actually had contemplated quitting because it was still so stressful. I was commuting to a school that was 70+ miles away. It was a one-way drive of an hour and a half or longer. I did that for two years. During that time, during that time during the last two, if not three semesters, I did clinical rotations that were in the same area. Another 70 miles away, I was getting up early, driving down coming back, coming back coming back.",2,bartpodcasts
