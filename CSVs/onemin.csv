Tom Brady greatest of all time Now if you ask me Patriots fan, obviously, I'm going to tell you that he's staying put but if you ask me as an NFL fan. You staying put it just doesn't make sense for me for? Somebody like him somebody that has been in the NFL for just about 20 years spent it all with one team just doesn't make sense for me to it's just doesn't make sense to me. So it doesn't make sense to me for this man the go out and play for another team at 43 years old after spending his entire career playing for the New England Patriots. It just doesn't make sense for me, but you know, obviously They were not Tom Brady. Do I think he can do it? Of course he can I just don't think it makes sense for him. I do think that the Patriots need to buckle down and get him help. He has been doing way too much by himself for quite some time last year. We had a solid defense. Yeah, but he had nobody to throw do I know they tried to get him some help with bring it in antoniou Brown at the beginning of the year.",1,onemin

No matter where they've grown up or what they've heard all their lives and it's an incredible chapter it lists out all the ways that we can act basically in sin and have a depraved mind and then it leads us right into Romans Chapter 2, which says that We don't have any room to pass judgment because we're guilty of the same things which leads us right into a beautiful chapter 3 talking about how we've all fallen short of the glory of God and that's why we needed Jesus and that's why God sent Jesus.
