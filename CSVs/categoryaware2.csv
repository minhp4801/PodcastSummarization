Your breath the breath of life, kissing my lips, your breathing keeps me high. You make me high, higher than the mountains, kissing skies lighter than clouds weighed down by rain.

The ideal position for this meditation is to be laying down on your back with your legs lengthened out, arms at your sides. You can also do this in a seated position. If you are sitting, you want to make sure that your back is flat against your chair or wall. Make sure that you have your feet flat on the ground, ankles lined up with your knees. Once you find either you're sitting or laying in a laying position with your hands, I want you to find your navel. With your thumbs, identify the navel and then you place your hands right hand right underneath and left hand on top so that your hands are resting on your abdomen.
