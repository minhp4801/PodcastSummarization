What am I going to do? What am going to wear? How do I feel about this? What do I think about this and we talked on Sunday about how instead of honoring God is God.",1,bartcnn

Of course. The stoics were materialists and so Cicero is not saying that the mind is made of matter nor is he saying that stoics practice can somehow make people in vulnerable to pain even the sage sage.
